I've gotta throw a few words in here.  I know this has been brought up before, but I think it got overlooked.  We're all debating whether or not to mention the qualities of being homophobic or anti-homosexual in the lead paragraph.  I can agree that """"homophobic"""" might be misleading, as there's no evidence I can cite that proves he's actually AFRAID of gay people.  However, there is mountains of evidence that he is against gays in general, the gay movement, the gay agenda, whatever.  Let's face facts (not opinions, not passive observations, but facts).  The man hasn't walked a step, spoken a word, inhaled or exhaled in the course of recorded history without firing off some quip about how homosexuals are damning the world and what have you.

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

I am sanctioned to give another 50 words of justification to any revert until the end of June so here it goes. Besides what I stated above, here are my thoughts: I have nothing contrary to the citation of a contemporary author that has done a serious study on Vojsava Tripalda and doesn't blindly repeat that she was from Serbian origin. The only contemporary scholar that we have to claim that Voisava Tripalda was from Serbian origin is Spandounes, who says only that, and then he points to the biography of Marin Barleti. Now Barleti doesn't say that she was Serbian, but Albanian, so Spandounes contradicts himself. If we really want to give some references to Skanderbeg that are sour, let's start with Oliver Jens Schmitt who really has made a bad biography of the national hero of the Albanians. Schmitt is a voice out of the choir and I would love if someone brings to the table what he says, because I want to see if he is fringe or serious. Let's talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 User:Alien3 thinks I'm edit warring... 

...which is confusing, since I'm not even close to 3RR. But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as """"progressive."""" Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. 

All that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as """"impartial"""" (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an """"impartial media watchdog,"""" replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.

To the end of sidestepping the whole issue, I'd like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization: . But I don't think it should appear in the lede, either.

Hello, thank you for the kindly reply, in the Bruce Lee book [] about martial arts legend Bruce Lee, written by his widow, Linda Lee Cadwell it is declared that Warner Brothers took away the part of """"The Warrior"""" and turned it into """"Kung-Fu"""" for the above reason's already mentioned.

It is agreed that the movie with Jason Scott Lee that took """"some"""" dramatic licence or elements of course for some of the dramatic purposes only, however the movie was actually based on the book by Bruce's widow Linda, and written shortly after his death also that it was Linda herself, Mrs. Bruce Lee herself who did the final narration at the films end.

The George Takei narrated video is also a worthy review wiki friend, as it does in fact state what was cited in regard to the Studio taking his idea of """"The Warrior"""" in that it was giving a new name and another actor for the earlier reason's specified in my careful edit you helped me realise on the page.

Since we can't look into each other's hearts, and since there can be no assessment of behavior until there is behavior (the only """"behavior"""" now is an occasional note on his talk page), what is it that you would like to hear from Kiefer? And what kinds of restrictions, if any, do you think can be helpful? An Iban with Demiurge is probably a given, as is some type of restriction on RfA, AN(/I) participation, etc. FWIW, I accept his comments about the offending remark; it would have been better if he had swallowed a bit more pride, and it's clear that I'm probably in the minority there, but I do accept it.I sent Kiefer an email a week or so ago, to see how he was doingafter all, we both were blessed with a beautiful child around the same time last yearand I'm trying to figure out a way to heal some wounds. For the record, I have had my disagreements with him and I certainly don't approve of everything he's done here (I'm sure he feels the same way, and that's fine). I don't wish to be an apologist (for any side) and excuse everything that's happened, but I'm trying to find a way forward. I wish, for instance, that he would find it easier to let bygones be bygones (I think I'm paraphrasing GiantSnowman, from an AN thread about a proposed Iban between the two of them, and I wish KF had accepted that from GS). Anyway, this message is longer than I intended it to be, and I apologize for that. I suppose I'm also asking you if (or when) you can let bygones be bygones.

Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned.

Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up.

Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography. The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.:

 Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Actually, I've been neutral towards the """"Paris area"""" proposition. 3 people have supported the move, 5 people have opposed it (including Jared's """"weak oppose"""") and 5 people have been neutral. Outside few exceptions like Bob's vote, most of the oppose and neutral votes were motivated by the fact that, in regards to the content of the article, the title """"in Paris"""" has been felt as already implying the Paris urban area in respect of English common usage and that adding anything wasn't formally necessary.

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship? I don't know here.

Error in reasoning. Post-Hardcore is perhaps another variant of Hardcore punk, because it cames from Hardcore punk. But if Lacuna Coil was a Gothic METAL band, they cannot be a Post-Gothic ROCK band, because they never played Gothic ROCK. Thus they're a Post-Gothic-METAL band. That's a big stylistical difference.

If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. 
 تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.
 Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  
 As per Arbcomm, there are admins I can report personal attacks outside of there and thus I mentioned the warning.   I have no interest for getting personal as you said either.  So lets keep it professional.  Thanks",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.

I'm very aware that there are a lot of idiots or militants around on the internet, and they probably don't know that the laicité concept has since its beginning been openly directed against the catholic church which was thought to be way too much powerful at that time (1905). The law about religious symbols in school, although badly written (the proposal was to ban *all* religious symbols in primary and secondary schools) is a direct application of this one century-old philosophy as written in the constitution, so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it. This law that you call the French Hijab ban neither concerns only the Hijab, nor is a ban of the Hijab in general, I see Hijab every day when I go back to France. Also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false, or very rare.

So it's law on secularism, and an alleged example of islamophobia for some islamic militants/multcularism proponents in the US/UK, and does absolutely not match the sentance above  Islamophobic incidences are a fact, just like anti-semitic acts

The Crying of Lot 49

1

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

""""Mucho, baby,"""" she cried, in an access of helplessness.

Mucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. """"Today was another defeat,"""" he began.

If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.

Hello ChrisScorsese88, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to List of Jessie episodes has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

 Was there any usage of the """"Cham"""" term, before the 20th or 19th Century?
 Was the cham eviction specifically ordered by British liaison to EDES, Col. Chris Woodhouse?

In which he reports that the Muslim Chams of Thesprotia come from native Christian Greeks of which for different reasons and at different times converted to Islam.
 Why is Kollias an unreliable source whereas Vickers is one?
 Are the refs used to create the Map of Chameria WP:RS? And why are they self-contradicting?
 Is a definition and Synonyms of the Word Cham in Babiniotis dictionary enough to use as the definitive source of these statement:
The name """"Cham"""", together with that of the region, """"Chameria"""", is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the local Greek hydronym Thyamis (Θύαμις in Greek, Çam in Albanian) or from the ancient Thraco-Illyrian tribe of Sameis
 Why isn't this included in the article:

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

""""-sotho"""" is a root, which is made meaningful with class markers (Sesotho, Basotho, Lesotho, etc).

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

In your future dealings with editors on articles please be aware of the above policy that says you should discuss any changes after your bold change has been reverted on the article talk page. In other words: 
 You being bold. (which is great).

 You should of Discussed.

Please bear this in mind in future. This is so that you can fully justify your reasoning behind the changes, and are not caught up in pointless edit wars going back and forth and then you yourself cannot be accused of edit warring. Look forward to working with you.   ✉  

 I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times, then be discussed. And I have seen several main editors, who I'm sure you would know if named, who dodn't follow BRD at all.
 And I wasn't going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it. If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it.
 But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.   

Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, """"do as I say not as I do"""" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong. 
It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it. I do not believe that it is classed as """"paranormal"""" the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genre's listed in the opening lead.   ✉  

 The idea of free will also comes to mind. Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think """"fantasy"""" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.   
Good idea. I'll get rid of it. A source isn't usually needed for every genre. I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page. Just so other involved can par take.   ✉  
 Woops, just realised I moved this over to my archive. Meant to only move the two dormant posts.

Sorry i was away for a while, just saw your comment.

The term 'Candelabra' was coined by William White Howells (Mankind in the Making, 1959) to describe Coon's view of the origin of the races. Its completely incorrect, but nonetheless the only term which has ever been used to describe Coon's evolutionary model. Its incorrect because Howell's misinterpretated Weidenreich's polycentric (multiregional) origin of the races, which actually includes large amounts of gene-flow (regional interbreeding) when he wrongly believed it was a parallel (polygenic) model of the races. However Coon stressed far less on this gene-flow, but still allowed for it. So basically neither Weidenreich nor Coon's multiregionalism is true parallel or polygenic evolution, however Coon's model comes far closer to it, as his model doesn't take much interbreeding into account, his geneflow is very minimal. Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution pp. 114-115 (see on google books) has a full discussion, pointing all this out. Coon also believed the racial developments and splits were long before sapienization, and that they were present in archaic homo and even earlier. If you read his Racial Adaptations (1982) he briefly discusses his idea that the Australopithecine's were already split into the races, for example he sees Mongoloid dental traits in one regional variation. However true polyphyletic or polygenism models on the origins of the races died out in the late 19th century. Karl Vogt for example argued the different races were never at any one point related, and that they evolved from different primates.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

AFC Creation
Please take a look at the articles created that were deleted.  Some of the sources I had previously used were not what they consider to be reliable sources.  After the non reliable sources were mentioned to me, I stopped using them.  I started to only use sources that appeared on google news or on google books.  I have even gone to the reliable sources noticeboard to see if sources were good to use.   The SPI wasn't frivolous as a number of editors were previously investigated as being members of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Papaursa/Archive     Other admins (. St★lwart111) have stated that there were problems in WP:TAGTEAM .   specifically    Most of my articles are about individuals who were are notable via wiki standards such as African Americans sports players during segregation James “Pappy” Ricks, Olympians such as Thomas Martin (judoka) or National Champions such as Howard Fish.   
With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """". Systemic bias is a recognized issue on Wikipedia""""    Some of the deleted articles, I am waiting for more sources to appear such as Al Gotay, which was speedily deleted even I replied to a prod, another user wrote another message stating it should be deleted (it never even made it to AFD).  
I have previously used Articles for Creation , but the backlog is so big that it is frustrating to use.   I did say, I create so others can work.  Meaning we all have skills that can be used on wikipedia.  To me an article is like building a car on a production line.  I put in the headlights, others put on the wheels, others put on the seats, etc.   I don't own any articles I create.  I rarely revert edits.  I find topics of individuals whom I believe are noteworthy and create them.

find additional sources .  I have improved in my article creation and firmly believe that if you put me on a creation ban, I will simply retire from wikipedia out of sheer frustration.

Hello, Director.sara, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

As to The Church of Jesus Christ, they are big enough, I think, with about 15,000 members, to merit an article in their own right. I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.

The evidence is in the photographs of Margherita and her family and my father's family - obvious close genetic similarities. Also in some common personality characteristics. I have no documentary proof of course. Remember I was born in Brooklyn just at the start of WWII and my mother intentionally dropped the final """"i"""" in my birth certificate to hide the connection. Everything was done to cover up the connection for obvious reasons since we were at war with Italy at the time. The best evidence I have is from my Aunt Victoria Sarfatti as related above. Also when I was in Brazil with Fred Alan Wolf in 1984 wined and dined by the wealthiest people in Brazil, an older woman came up to me and said, """"I knew Margherita Sarfatti."""" She simply assumed I was her blood relative from looking at me. I made no mention of the connection at that meeting. It was not relevant. In any case that is really not the point.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

Hope to hear from you when you have a moment.  Best.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

Fadix is right. This page gives special treatment to Turkey, unlike similar pages on massacres, genocide, etc. It doesn't deserve a single bit more.
Blue there is nothing wrong with having an academic position. If you object to that then I guess it's because you want to lend credance to the Turkish government's position, as you feel it desperately needs it.

Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs of electrolysis using hydro-electric power, tidal, or wind.  In an ocean based plant using the sea water (a natural electrolyte which electrolyzes better than pure water) with tidal power, wind, and solar operating in tandem the costs would be VERY cheap.  And, the costs must be considered to be amortized over the lifetime of the plant.  Solar panels, windmills, and tidal generators have a one-time, fixed cost, and then they run basically for free until repairs become necessary.  

Statistics designed to make electrolysis of water look expensive are easy to fabricate.  However, you must show where these supposed costs are coming from.  In addition, the people who claim that electrolysis of water is as polluting as hydrocracking always assume that the electricity must be generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.  People conveniently overlook all the factors that don't suit their basic belief or economic interest.

The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very """"skilled"""" at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,

British North America Act 1867

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.

(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: 
1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867. 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a """"constitutition"""" when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   

What?
""""Canada"""" had no Constitution until 1982?

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight.

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

Tioga County Results
Howard Mills did not win Tioga county.  On election night it first appeared as though he did.  However when the Board of Elections counted the absentee and affidavit ballots he lost.

Howard Mills received 9,602 votes on the Republican Party line.

Charles Schumer received 9,790 votes on the Democratic Party line, plus 647 votes on the Independence Party line and 435 votes on the Working Families Line for a total of 10,872 votes to Howard Mills 9,602.

Oh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.
Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.
And were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)
And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.
And yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

 Dear Mr. Jim Handerson, please read the 09:58 16 July 2012 fightingagainstlies edition of the article. You will understand that what I am mentioned. 

Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6]

Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953)

Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.

Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18

In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey"""" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.

A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)

He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.

Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.

According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.

Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.

Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a """"revolutionary design"""" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial """"flat turret"""" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped """"hexagonal turret"""" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.

As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  

Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.

DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text """"awful"""", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:

1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie """"Alexander Nevsky"""", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.

2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.

But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.
