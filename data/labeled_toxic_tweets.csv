I've gotta throw a few words in here.  I know this has been brought up before, but I think it got overlooked.  We're all debating whether or not to mention the qualities of being homophobic or anti-homosexual in the lead paragraph.  I can agree that """"homophobic"""" might be misleading, as there's no evidence I can cite that proves he's actually AFRAID of gay people.  However, there is mountains of evidence that he is against gays in general, the gay movement, the gay agenda, whatever.  Let's face facts (not opinions, not passive observations, but facts).  The man hasn't walked a step, spoken a word, inhaled or exhaled in the course of recorded history without firing off some quip about how homosexuals are damning the world and what have you.

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

I'll let you know whether you care or not...:

I am sanctioned to give another 50 words of justification to any revert until the end of June so here it goes. Besides what I stated above, here are my thoughts: I have nothing contrary to the citation of a contemporary author that has done a serious study on Vojsava Tripalda and doesn't blindly repeat that she was from Serbian origin. The only contemporary scholar that we have to claim that Voisava Tripalda was from Serbian origin is Spandounes, who says only that, and then he points to the biography of Marin Barleti. Now Barleti doesn't say that she was Serbian, but Albanian, so Spandounes contradicts himself. If we really want to give some references to Skanderbeg that are sour, let's start with Oliver Jens Schmitt who really has made a bad biography of the national hero of the Albanians. Schmitt is a voice out of the choir and I would love if someone brings to the table what he says, because I want to see if he is fringe or serious. Let's talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 User:Alien3 thinks I'm edit warring... 

...which is confusing, since I'm not even close to 3RR. But, anyway, I thought I'd drop by and explain my reasons for pulling the cite from the first sentence of the article. Per WP:LEDECITE: 
Leads are usually written at a greater level of generality than the body, and information in the lead section of non-controversial subjects is less likely to be challenged and less likely to require a source.... 
Pedantic semantic squabbling aside, I don't think there's anyone who contests the validity of the characterization of MM as """"progressive."""" Given that the same assertion is sourced exactly one paragraph later, I think the citation should be cut from the lede. 

All that said, I'm not sold on MM being a reliable source for characterizations about itself. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that MM described itself as """"impartial"""" (it doesn't, btw). Would it be alright, then, for Wikipedia to describe MM as an """"impartial media watchdog,"""" replete with cite to their web site? IMO, MM can't be a WP:RS for information about MM; they're biased, and anything they say about themselves is inherently POV. What's more, if we're not taking MM at their word, but, instead, only citing them for claims that Wikipedia editors find credible, that's differently problematic for being WP:OR. It's not our place to weigh the veracity of primary sources; we shouldn't even be using them.

To the end of sidestepping the whole issue, I'd like to offer this source instead for the claim that MM is a progressive organization: . But I don't think it should appear in the lede, either.

Hello, thank you for the kindly reply, in the Bruce Lee book [] about martial arts legend Bruce Lee, written by his widow, Linda Lee Cadwell it is declared that Warner Brothers took away the part of """"The Warrior"""" and turned it into """"Kung-Fu"""" for the above reason's already mentioned.

It is agreed that the movie with Jason Scott Lee that took """"some"""" dramatic licence or elements of course for some of the dramatic purposes only, however the movie was actually based on the book by Bruce's widow Linda, and written shortly after his death also that it was Linda herself, Mrs. Bruce Lee herself who did the final narration at the films end.

The George Takei narrated video is also a worthy review wiki friend, as it does in fact state what was cited in regard to the Studio taking his idea of """"The Warrior"""" in that it was giving a new name and another actor for the earlier reason's specified in my careful edit you helped me realise on the page.

Since we can't look into each other's hearts, and since there can be no assessment of behavior until there is behavior (the only """"behavior"""" now is an occasional note on his talk page), what is it that you would like to hear from Kiefer? And what kinds of restrictions, if any, do you think can be helpful? An Iban with Demiurge is probably a given, as is some type of restriction on RfA, AN(/I) participation, etc. FWIW, I accept his comments about the offending remark; it would have been better if he had swallowed a bit more pride, and it's clear that I'm probably in the minority there, but I do accept it.I sent Kiefer an email a week or so ago, to see how he was doingafter all, we both were blessed with a beautiful child around the same time last yearand I'm trying to figure out a way to heal some wounds. For the record, I have had my disagreements with him and I certainly don't approve of everything he's done here (I'm sure he feels the same way, and that's fine). I don't wish to be an apologist (for any side) and excuse everything that's happened, but I'm trying to find a way forward. I wish, for instance, that he would find it easier to let bygones be bygones (I think I'm paraphrasing GiantSnowman, from an AN thread about a proposed Iban between the two of them, and I wish KF had accepted that from GS). Anyway, this message is longer than I intended it to be, and I apologize for that. I suppose I'm also asking you if (or when) you can let bygones be bygones.

Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned.

Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up.

Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

Obviously I disagree with the note about the photographs. The term """"graphic"""" tends to inappropriately stigmatize the nature of the photography. The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.:

 Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate

 Breast_implant

If you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer's work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Actually, I've been neutral towards the """"Paris area"""" proposition. 3 people have supported the move, 5 people have opposed it (including Jared's """"weak oppose"""") and 5 people have been neutral. Outside few exceptions like Bob's vote, most of the oppose and neutral votes were motivated by the fact that, in regards to the content of the article, the title """"in Paris"""" has been felt as already implying the Paris urban area in respect of English common usage and that adding anything wasn't formally necessary.

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship? I don't know here.

Error in reasoning. Post-Hardcore is perhaps another variant of Hardcore punk, because it cames from Hardcore punk. But if Lacuna Coil was a Gothic METAL band, they cannot be a Post-Gothic ROCK band, because they never played Gothic ROCK. Thus they're a Post-Gothic-METAL band. That's a big stylistical difference.

If Kasravi is quoted by scholars such as Minorsky, Frye, Savory then his historical works are obviously acceptable.  Also note this: []  Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources. See Wikipedia:Verifiability#Sources..  Note that is why I quote from Savory a Safavid historian and say that he is stronger source than Tapper who is an anthropologist.  And furthermore I asked for direct proof with regards to your statement.  Actually you quote says: Esmail I proclaimed himself Shah of Azerbaijan.  Now I ask where?  And then you bring me a quote from Tapper who is an anthropologist.  Then I of course say that Savory who is a Safavid historian with much more qualifications does not claim Esmail I made such a proclamation.   It is true that he controlled Gilan also (but perhaps not all of it).. As per Iran , it is mentioned as the country of Safavids by many sources.  Including Sultan Selim I when he attacked Iran. 
 تا ز استانبول لشکر سوی ایران تاختم تاج صوفی غرقه خون و ملامت ساختم.  Thus we have a direct source referring to the country of Esmail I as Iran .  And I do not need to bring direct reference like this because Safavid historians are strong enough source to quote.
 Note I repeat from the source. Although initially ruler of Azerbaijan only, by the year 916/1510 Esma@¿^l was master of the whole of Persia, having crushed the residual forces of the Aq Qoyunlu and driven the Uzbeks out of the northeastern frontier province of Khorasan..  seems correct but either way it is from strong source.  But until we have proof of proclamation from Esmail I himself  I am the Shah of Azerbaijan, then claiming Esmail I proclaimed himself shah of Azerbaijan is not valid.  He proclaimed himself Shah in Azerbaijan is different though as he was crowned in Tarbiz.  And yes he did own part of Gilan as well, and this angle can be argued from Encyclopedia Islam quote which I have brought above already.  So basically I am asking you for the Minorsky quote you mentioned but quoting from an anthropologist when it contradicts Safavid historians or when Safavid historians are stronger source in my opinion is not valid.  
 As per Arbcomm, there are admins I can report personal attacks outside of there and thus I mentioned the warning.   I have no interest for getting personal as you said either.  So lets keep it professional.  Thanks",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.

I'm very aware that there are a lot of idiots or militants around on the internet, and they probably don't know that the laicité concept has since its beginning been openly directed against the catholic church which was thought to be way too much powerful at that time (1905). The law about religious symbols in school, although badly written (the proposal was to ban *all* religious symbols in primary and secondary schools) is a direct application of this one century-old philosophy as written in the constitution, so this neologism is just not adequate to describe it. This law that you call the French Hijab ban neither concerns only the Hijab, nor is a ban of the Hijab in general, I see Hijab every day when I go back to France. Also the other lies about muslim girls who would not be able to receive an education have now proven to be false, or very rare.

So it's law on secularism, and an alleged example of islamophobia for some islamic militants/multcularism proponents in the US/UK, and does absolutely not match the sentance above  Islamophobic incidences are a fact, just like anti-semitic acts

The Crying of Lot 49

1

ONE summer afternoon Mrs Oedipa Maas came home from a Tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much kirsch in the fondue to find that she, Oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one Pierce Inverarity, a California real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.

The letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (""""Mucho"""") Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. """"Pierce, please,"""" she'd managed to get in, """"I thought we had""""

""""But Margo,"""" earnestly, """"I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,"""" or something.

""""For God's sake,"""" she said. Mucho had rolled over and was looking at her.

""""Why don't you hang up on him,"""" Mucho suggested, sensibly.

""""I heard that,"""" Pierce said. """"I think it's time Wendell Maas had a little visit from The Shadow."""" Silence, positive and thorough, fell. So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.

""""Mucho, baby,"""" she cried, in an access of helplessness.

Mucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. """"Today was another defeat,"""" he began.

If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.

Hello ChrisScorsese88, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to List of Jessie episodes has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

 Was there any usage of the """"Cham"""" term, before the 20th or 19th Century?
 Was the cham eviction specifically ordered by British liaison to EDES, Col. Chris Woodhouse?

In which he reports that the Muslim Chams of Thesprotia come from native Christian Greeks of which for different reasons and at different times converted to Islam.
 Why is Kollias an unreliable source whereas Vickers is one?
 Are the refs used to create the Map of Chameria WP:RS? And why are they self-contradicting?
 Is a definition and Synonyms of the Word Cham in Babiniotis dictionary enough to use as the definitive source of these statement:
The name """"Cham"""", together with that of the region, """"Chameria"""", is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the local Greek hydronym Thyamis (Θύαμις in Greek, Çam in Albanian) or from the ancient Thraco-Illyrian tribe of Sameis
 Why isn't this included in the article:

You raise several interesting points.

On the matter of plagiarism in general: Yes, you're right; if a Wikipedia page is remarkably similar to a page elsewhere, that doesn't mean that the WP page plagiarized the other: it could have been the other way around, or something more complex may have happened.

On this page: Its history shows an almost uninterrupted growth to this state, before the trimming started. I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.

Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.

So maybe I have an """"overly critical attitude"""". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)

Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source. 

This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.

So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:

Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.

Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why """"British art photography"""" (my emphasis)? How were they """"pivotal""""? This stuff would have to be sourced. (Yes, writing for WP is a bitch.)

""""-sotho"""" is a root, which is made meaningful with class markers (Sesotho, Basotho, Lesotho, etc).

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

In your future dealings with editors on articles please be aware of the above policy that says you should discuss any changes after your bold change has been reverted on the article talk page. In other words: 
 You being bold. (which is great).

 You should of Discussed.

Please bear this in mind in future. This is so that you can fully justify your reasoning behind the changes, and are not caught up in pointless edit wars going back and forth and then you yourself cannot be accused of edit warring. Look forward to working with you.   ✉  

 I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times, then be discussed. And I have seen several main editors, who I'm sure you would know if named, who dodn't follow BRD at all.
 And I wasn't going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it. If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it.
 But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.   

Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, """"do as I say not as I do"""" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong. 
It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it. I do not believe that it is classed as """"paranormal"""" the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genre's listed in the opening lead.   ✉  

 The idea of free will also comes to mind. Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think """"fantasy"""" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.   
Good idea. I'll get rid of it. A source isn't usually needed for every genre. I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page. Just so other involved can par take.   ✉  
 Woops, just realised I moved this over to my archive. Meant to only move the two dormant posts.

Sorry i was away for a while, just saw your comment.

The term 'Candelabra' was coined by William White Howells (Mankind in the Making, 1959) to describe Coon's view of the origin of the races. Its completely incorrect, but nonetheless the only term which has ever been used to describe Coon's evolutionary model. Its incorrect because Howell's misinterpretated Weidenreich's polycentric (multiregional) origin of the races, which actually includes large amounts of gene-flow (regional interbreeding) when he wrongly believed it was a parallel (polygenic) model of the races. However Coon stressed far less on this gene-flow, but still allowed for it. So basically neither Weidenreich nor Coon's multiregionalism is true parallel or polygenic evolution, however Coon's model comes far closer to it, as his model doesn't take much interbreeding into account, his geneflow is very minimal. Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Human Evolution pp. 114-115 (see on google books) has a full discussion, pointing all this out. Coon also believed the racial developments and splits were long before sapienization, and that they were present in archaic homo and even earlier. If you read his Racial Adaptations (1982) he briefly discusses his idea that the Australopithecine's were already split into the races, for example he sees Mongoloid dental traits in one regional variation. However true polyphyletic or polygenism models on the origins of the races died out in the late 19th century. Karl Vogt for example argued the different races were never at any one point related, and that they evolved from different primates.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

AFC Creation
Please take a look at the articles created that were deleted.  Some of the sources I had previously used were not what they consider to be reliable sources.  After the non reliable sources were mentioned to me, I stopped using them.  I started to only use sources that appeared on google news or on google books.  I have even gone to the reliable sources noticeboard to see if sources were good to use.   The SPI wasn't frivolous as a number of editors were previously investigated as being members of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Papaursa/Archive     Other admins (. St★lwart111) have stated that there were problems in WP:TAGTEAM .   specifically    Most of my articles are about individuals who were are notable via wiki standards such as African Americans sports players during segregation James “Pappy” Ricks, Olympians such as Thomas Martin (judoka) or National Champions such as Howard Fish.   
With 140 articles about 9 have been deleted.  This isn't a horrible percentage. This is under 10%.  Considering that most of the individuals who were deleted were African American Judo fighters, I pointed out that statistic, to which they claimed I claimed I said they were racist or bigoted.  I never stated anyone was a racist or a bigot.  I pointed out a statistic.  After this issue was closed, one user tried to revive the issue, to which an admin stated """". Systemic bias is a recognized issue on Wikipedia""""    Some of the deleted articles, I am waiting for more sources to appear such as Al Gotay, which was speedily deleted even I replied to a prod, another user wrote another message stating it should be deleted (it never even made it to AFD).  
I have previously used Articles for Creation , but the backlog is so big that it is frustrating to use.   I did say, I create so others can work.  Meaning we all have skills that can be used on wikipedia.  To me an article is like building a car on a production line.  I put in the headlights, others put on the wheels, others put on the seats, etc.   I don't own any articles I create.  I rarely revert edits.  I find topics of individuals whom I believe are noteworthy and create them.

find additional sources .  I have improved in my article creation and firmly believe that if you put me on a creation ban, I will simply retire from wikipedia out of sheer frustration.

Hello, Director.sara, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

As to The Church of Jesus Christ, they are big enough, I think, with about 15,000 members, to merit an article in their own right. I think there's verifiable material on the group's current practices and doctrines, although I'm not familiar enough with it. As to the much smaller groups like the Cutlerites and the Strangites, I think their notability comes from their history. There used to be a lot more members, and they had significant interactions with early Mormons. For the FLDS Church, there's not much verifiable information about their current practices, but they are in the news so much that they should definitely have an article. Basically, though, I see no problem with allowing an article for any distinct religious denomination. There may not be much verifiable information, but as long as they are either in the news, or have some historical significance, or have published things, that seems notable enough for me. As to particular church buildings or single congregations of a denomination, that's probably where I'd draw the line, unless that particular church building or congregation has some special significance.

The evidence is in the photographs of Margherita and her family and my father's family - obvious close genetic similarities. Also in some common personality characteristics. I have no documentary proof of course. Remember I was born in Brooklyn just at the start of WWII and my mother intentionally dropped the final """"i"""" in my birth certificate to hide the connection. Everything was done to cover up the connection for obvious reasons since we were at war with Italy at the time. The best evidence I have is from my Aunt Victoria Sarfatti as related above. Also when I was in Brazil with Fred Alan Wolf in 1984 wined and dined by the wealthiest people in Brazil, an older woman came up to me and said, """"I knew Margherita Sarfatti."""" She simply assumed I was her blood relative from looking at me. I made no mention of the connection at that meeting. It was not relevant. In any case that is really not the point.

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

Hope to hear from you when you have a moment.  Best.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

Fadix is right. This page gives special treatment to Turkey, unlike similar pages on massacres, genocide, etc. It doesn't deserve a single bit more.
Blue there is nothing wrong with having an academic position. If you object to that then I guess it's because you want to lend credance to the Turkish government's position, as you feel it desperately needs it.

Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs of electrolysis using hydro-electric power, tidal, or wind.  In an ocean based plant using the sea water (a natural electrolyte which electrolyzes better than pure water) with tidal power, wind, and solar operating in tandem the costs would be VERY cheap.  And, the costs must be considered to be amortized over the lifetime of the plant.  Solar panels, windmills, and tidal generators have a one-time, fixed cost, and then they run basically for free until repairs become necessary.  

Statistics designed to make electrolysis of water look expensive are easy to fabricate.  However, you must show where these supposed costs are coming from.  In addition, the people who claim that electrolysis of water is as polluting as hydrocracking always assume that the electricity must be generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.  People conveniently overlook all the factors that don't suit their basic belief or economic interest.

The Government of Canada (mainly Liberal since 1963) is very """"skilled"""" at practising the Sin Of Omission as shown in the linked text below,

British North America Act 1867

http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html

This website incorrectly refers to this document as the Constitution Act 1867, which is a misnomer, and a shameful one, indeed.

(2)  As enacted by the Constitution Act, 1982, which came into force on April 17, 1982. The section, as originally enacted, read as follows: 
1. This Act may be cited as The British North America Act, 1867. 
 

 

I disagree with your interpretation.  You're reading a footnote, which merely says that *originally* the 1867 act was to be cited as the British North America Act 1867.  But, under the law since 1982, it is now to be cited as the Constitution Act 1867.  All acts forming the constiution were retroactively renamed.  Judicial decisions, and subsequent legislation, use this new naming system.  This reflects the fact that these documents were not a part of a """"constitutition"""" when originally created, since Canada had no consitution until 1982.  Collectively, these acts were turned into a constitution, and hence renamed.   

What?
""""Canada"""" had no Constitution until 1982?

You are completely wrong as well as per retroactive re-naming, that is not what happened at all.  Please get your facts straight.

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

Tioga County Results
Howard Mills did not win Tioga county.  On election night it first appeared as though he did.  However when the Board of Elections counted the absentee and affidavit ballots he lost.

Howard Mills received 9,602 votes on the Republican Party line.

Charles Schumer received 9,790 votes on the Democratic Party line, plus 647 votes on the Independence Party line and 435 votes on the Working Families Line for a total of 10,872 votes to Howard Mills 9,602.

Oh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.
Jerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.
And were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)
And about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.
And yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us.

 Dear Mr. Jim Handerson, please read the 09:58 16 July 2012 fightingagainstlies edition of the article. You will understand that what I am mentioned. 

Oktay Sinanoğlu (born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy) is a Turkish scientist specializing in theoretical chemistry and molecular biology. In his autobiographical book which titled """"The Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book""""[1] he describes himself as: """"A person who was the world's youngest professor in the last 300 years,""""[2] """"at the peak of the science in the U.S.A.,""""[3] """"a man who reached the level to say, """"I'm God"""" in science,""""[4] """"the Lord of the U.S.A.,""""[5] and """"The Turkish Einstein.""""[6]

Childhood and High School Years (1934-1953)

Sinanoğlu was born on August 2, 1934 in Bari, Italy, where his father (Nüzhet Haşim Sinanoğlu) served as a consul general. In 1939 - at the beginning of World War II - the family returned to Turkey. He graduated high school in Turkey in the year 1953. This high school's name was """"Ankara Maarif College"""" since 1951.[7] The courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology in this school had been given by English teachers in the English language since 1949.[8][9] Sinanoglu learned the English language very well in this high school.

Serving American Military Intelligence at the age of 18

In his autobiographical book entitled """"Turkish Einstein Oktay Sinanoglu Book,"""" which was published in Turkey in the Turkish language (first printing in October 2001 and 70. printing in April 2011, a bestseller: 150,000 copies), he stated that, in the summer holiday 1952-1953, he applied to the JAMMAT """"Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey"""" (renamed JUSMMAT in 1958)[10][11][12] to get a job as a translator. His application was accepted by the U.S. Army Staff in Ankara, and he was sent on duty to Erzurum as translator for Secret G2 Military Intelligence Agents Sergeant Kowalski and Sergeant Peterson.[13] After graduating high school in 1953, a scholarship was given to him by the Fulbright Program to study chemistry in the United States.[14] According to the agreement, students were elected by the U.S. Education Commission in Turkey, but funding of the scholarship was provided by the government of Turkey, because Turkish students will return after graduation in the U.S.A to become teachers in Turkey. Sinanoglu was sent with this expectation to the U.S.A.

A University Student in the U.S.A. (1953-1960)

He arrived in New York on September 25, 1953.[15] According to his autobiographical book mentioned above, he stayed one year in Missouri [clarification needed], after which he went to California and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, with highest honors in chemical engineering. Afterwards, in eight months, he earned a Master's degree with highest honors from MIT (1957); and after this, in two years, he finished his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley (1959).[16] Subsequently, he finished a one-year postdoctoral research appointment at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California Berkeley (1959-1960).[17] So, his pupilage ended in 1960.

Violating Scholarship Agreement and Military Service Obligation to Live in the U.S.A.

According to the 1953 scholarship agreement, after graduation, Sinanoglu was obligated to return to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students.[18] Sinanoglu stated in his autobiographical book that: """"Returning to Turkey to teach chemistry to Turkish students in the English language was worse than death, a horrible and dishonorable thing. İnstead of this, to stay in the U.S.A. and to teach chemistry to American students in the English language was a more honorable thing. I swore that: I will not return to Turkey; I will stay in the U.S.A and I will be a chemistry teacher in American universities.”[19] So Sinanoglu violated the 1953 scholarship agreement and did not return to Turkey. But there was a second problem: According to the military service obligation laws of his country, after finishing his studies in 1960, Sinanoglu was to return to Turkey to fulfill an 18-month military service obligation. The penalty for violating the scholarship agreement was a fine: the payment of a sum of money. But the penalty for violating one's military service obligation was the cancellation of one's passport and visa; this penalty could not be paid by money in those years (1960s). He stated in his autobiographical book: """"Theoretical Physicist Feza Gursey wrote a letter to me inviting me to the Middle East Technical University which was being established in Ankara, Turkey. But I couldn't return to Turkey because of the military service obligation. If I went to Turkey, I would be a soldier for 2-2,5 years.""""[20] An easy way to stay in the U.S.A. was to marry and father a child in that country.

Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.

Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a """"revolutionary design"""" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial """"flat turret"""" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped """"hexagonal turret"""" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.

As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  

Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.  

____

DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text """"awful"""", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:

1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie """"Alexander Nevsky"""", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.

2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.

But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.

Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

Crime
first of all you need to monitor that """"Lanicoya"""" that just because she is from Nicaragua tries to take advantage of that to try to keep sections from being created. managua is a dangerous city and wether she like it or not it needs a crime section like san jose costa rica has one and like san salvador el salvador has one. Nicaragua Managua is not a safe city okay i had copy the article word by word and it now has been chaged okay. here it is.

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua reported these incidents: 

Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it. Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night, street crime is very common. Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs. The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007. 

Hotel Robberies 

On March 29, an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home. Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the robbery, a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s (the suspect) was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light. The victim walked the individual inside the home, where he inspected the light. The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools. As they got near the front door, the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a .25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money. The suspect took the victim’s wallet, took all of the cash and then, at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification, The suspect then departed the area on foot. 

On April 4, seventeen members of a U.S. missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua. The U.S. missionary group was given housing at a locally-owned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists. Four Nicaraguan males, including two armed with handguns, entered the dining room and took the group’s cell phones and all their money. Two of the suspects walked the members of the U.S missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras, additional cash and iPods. The robbery lasted one hour, a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP). The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive, however, until after the suspects had left the scene. None of the victims were badly hurt. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk, security, or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day; full-time uniformed security; access control precautions; a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area; and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents. 

Vehicular Break-Ins

In the early afternoon on April 21, a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua. The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur (South Highway), about two miles from the U.S. Embassy in Managua. When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store, a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said he’d watch the vehicle for money. The driver accepted this offer and the car’s passengers entered the gas station. When leaving the gas station, they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken. A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat. The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene. The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and, when possible, park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras.

The exiled map!

This map is alive only on my personal pages (since I created it) as an exile because of a dispute with 2 bias posters. There attitude was poor and they ultimately both disproved there nonsense and made me leave the U.K. railways in distress. Flaimers? 

The false 'allegations' were-

No time frame- It was on the map's title.

Bias because more accidents coming from English speaking states to the English Wikipedia- If that is of concern, then the Wikipedia article I used as a source is also guilty.

Bias because America has a big and busy railway- India has a world rebound railway, witch is both an example of big and busy! As for the non-stop life of the Japanese, German and British railways!

Noting the un-note-worthy- I literally copied the Wikipedia article in to a map, so that also goes back to say, that if anything, the article needs a good tidy up.

Name your sources- The Wikipedia article it was attached to.

To may variables to decipher- Were they indirectly questioning the whole article’s itegraty, since the map was only a literal coppy of the on-screen text.

Portrayed America in a poor light- If that's so, what about India, they were running a close second for 'Most rail crashes between 1950 and 2006. """"Whats good for the goose is good for the gander"""" as we say in the U.K.

The flamers never noticed-

They did not notice that I have missed of Eritrea's new railway or that Libya dose not have a railway, and said nothing when I corrected the map.

if someone understands the special theory of reletivity better than i do, can they please give some information on how distance applies generally in physics.

 More discussion on ANI 

Ryan has posted on ANI as follows.  Since I cannot reply there, I reply here.  

Ryan: Peter has been blocked previously on a different account for a harassment campaign against FT2 off wiki. 

Comment: This was hardly a 'campaign'.  Consisted of one off-wiki post on a blog that was deleted the next day.  Arbcom has the full details, these have been agreed.

Ryan: Now he resurrected a new account to evade the block and ended up getting blocked again by Thatcher - after discussion, Thatcher decided to unblock. 

After discussion with Arbcom.  The details of the discussion were private, and have never been disclosed by me or Arbcom or anyone else.

Ryan: Now, Peter has continued this off-wiki harassment campaign, turning to soapboxing his ideas about FT2 on WR. 

The basis of the original 'ideas' have now been admitted as true by certain members of the Arbitration committee.  The new 'ideas' are simply that in effect, FT2 is enabling the paedophile lobby.

Ryan: Today he decided to bring the harassment back on-wiki, claiming FT2 made a CU block to """"support the efforts of paedophiles"""" - the gravity of the harassment is large, coupled with the fact that he has a previous account blocked for exactly the same thing. 

As I have said a number of times above, I said that the effect of this action by FT2 is to enable the pro-paedophile lobby.  Please attend carefully to the grammar of the statement. The effect is that already the Pederasty has been reverted, hideous mistakes and all, such as quotations from Aristotle that never existed.     """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

This is something relatively new in wrestling, where WWE is using people like Brock, Taker, Rock, Sting, HHH, and Stephanie in spurts for feuds leading up to major shows, then they disappear/fade into the background for awhile, and then they come back for their next feud/match, and so on, and so on.

The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector.

 Articles for Creation Appeal 
Articles for Creation is backlogged and needs YOUR help!

Articles for Creation is desperately in need of reviewers! We are looking for urgent help, from experienced editors and administrators alike, to help us clear a record backlog of pending submissions. There is currently a significant backlog of  submissions waiting to be reviewed.  These submissions are generally from new editors who have never edited Wikipedia before.  A prompt, constructive review of submissions could significantly editor retention.

Do you have what it takes?
 Are you familiar with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines?
 Do you know what Wikipedia is and is not?
 Do you have a working knowledge of the Manual of Style, particularly article naming conventions?
 Are you (at least) autoconfirmed?
 Can you review submissions based on their individual merits?
If the answer to these questions is yes, then please read the reviewing instructions and donate a little of your time to helping tackle the backlog.

Click here to review to a random submissionArticle selected by erwin85's random article script on toolserver.

We would greatly appreciate your help.  Currently, only a small handful of users are reviewing articles.  Any help, even if it's just 1 or 2 reviews, would be extremely beneficial.

I'm sure you know what """"let alone"""" signifies; it's a commonly used phrase. There's a full list of British, Scottish, and English monarchs on this page. As such, if there's going to be a link to a plain list of monarchs, why would it be to List of British monarchs? Its content and more is already here.
If the lines are the same back to 1707, why not then link to List of Canadian monarchs? It, at least, doesn't duplicate in its entirety the aforementioned list in this article.

Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.

Thanks Nadiatalent, your comments are helpful and I've made another try at the Social issues text below, adding in new references for the first paragraph and placing the reference for Indonesia at the end of the second paragraph (an oversight on my part before). In this second try I have also made some changes to the wording of the first paragraph so that it is accurate to the references.

The new references for the first paragraph are studies on Malaysia and Indonesia. I'll provide quotes here so that you can see what they say about palm oil production's social impact:

1. Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Palm Oil Production: 
""""The data showed generally positive financial and socio-economic consequences of oil palm adoption in the immediate surroundings of oil palm estates.""""
""""In terms of industry and economic opportunities, OPCs [oil palm communities] feature more wood-based industries, and a higher numbers of shops, minimarkets and hotels.""""

2, The local impacts of oil palm expansion in Malaysia: 
""""According to respondents, the primary reasons for shifting from traditional livelihood activities to oil palm cultivation were higher returns for oil palm due to perceived high prices (43.3%) and perceived ease of managing oil palm plantations (30%).""""
""""Generally, oil palm has brought positive impacts, such as increased income, secure employment, and improved access to social services. However, involvement in oil palm has also caused many local communities to move away from traditional practices.""""
See also the table of results on page 11 which lists """"Increased income"""", """"More steady or reliable income"""", """"Education"""", """"Better access to transport services"""", """"Health facilities"""", """"Accommodation"""" as survey respondents' perceived benefits of palm oil production.

For the point about landholders being able to participate in the cash economy, I think the existing reference works. Here is the quote:

""""...the authority has set up a number of joint ventures with NCR [native customary rights] landholders. Under these agreements, local title-holders are paid a dividend, ensuring that part of the profits flow back into the community.""""

Oil palm is a valuable economic crop and provides a source of employment. It allows small landholders to participate in the cash economy and often results in improvements to local infrastructure and greater access to services such as schools and health facilities. In some areas, the cultivation of oil palm has replaced traditional practices, often due to the higher income potential of palm oil.

However, in some cases, land has been developed by oil palm plantations without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people occupying the land. This has occurred in Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and Indonesia. In the Sarawak state of Malaysian Borneo, there has been debate over whether there was an appropriate level of consultation with the Long Teran Kanan community prior to the develo",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Possible amicus appeals 

I thought this comment might be of interest. It indicates that anyone could file an appeal of the block, provided the blocked party indicates he wants to appeal it and indicates where he wants the appeal to be made. Under the circumstances, I think it might be possible that a thread could be opened, maybe at ANI, requesting the block be lifted, or, if that proves unsuccessful or doesn't appeal to you, requesting some sort of discretionary sanctions on individuals who might seek to prejudicially malign others. Under the circumstances, I think that there might be a reasonable chance of the block being lifted based on the prejudicial misrepresentation to which you were responding. Alternately, I think that there might be a very sound basis for requesting that backhanded libellous misrepresentation in the matter of the """"c""""-word might be made subject to discretionary sanctions on its own. 

The question of whether you want to appeal is obviously your choice. But, whether you choose to or not, I would be interested in knowing what you might think of maybe requesting discretionary sanctions regarding further misrepresentation.

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

Why? Required? Well, these questions go back to the old days. It used to be thought that redirects were bad, and we should avoid them, trying as hard as we can to replace them with the precise name. Then it was discovered that Google found things easier through redirects, and they provided a way for us refine Google's search semantics quite a bit. So it helps people find what they want, and avoids the problems of having to be too precise about linkages. Its more of a wiki way to do it. Not to mention that this type of linkage comes from our disambig policy, to use disambig pages liberally, but always be hierarchical according to common sense. More recently it was discovered that tools to """"fix"""" redirects (like the one in WP:POP) are hugely taxing on the server, so that ended the last of the purists crying about link precision. The funny thing is that link precision is actually a hindance to semantic searching. So, over the years the idea has been to make WP redirects function as a part of the semantic web.

Speedy deletion of Linesh
 A tag has been placed on Linesh requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.   | Talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I come here to contribute to and correct articles because many times articles state inaccuracies that must be corrected.

As coincidence would have it, I just happened to be reading The Jeffersonian Gunboat Navy by Spencer Tucker. During the ARW there were two terms used for these ships. One was """"gondola"""" (apparently not to be confused with the gondolas of Venice) and the other """"galley"""" but he makes no mention of """"row galley."""" Tucker is basically comparing """"gondola"""" and """"galley"""" as ancestors of """"gunboats"""" that appeared during Jefferson's time as president. 
However, I too have seen the US Navy using all three names: """"gondola"""", """"galley"""", and """"row galley."""" at random. Most of these terms are found in the various articles contained within DANFS. 
What needs to be said though is that I've found Tucker's works to be a bit sloppy and often lacking in full explanations. He tends to gloss over descriptions that really should be explained completely for clarity.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

That's very rich coming from you given your exhibited attitude. Sure, block me all you like but it won't change one iota of the fact that:
 You're the one-eyed leader of a pack of blind """"specialists"""" that insist on editing articles about Greece lacking basic information about the country at best (when censuses happen) or purposefully ignoring it at worst (did you ever do anything about the bogus """"census"""" number?).
 For all your """"expertise"""" the whole lot of your gang still cannot write something reliable when it comes to the numbers of linguistic groups in Greece. I drop the hint about the V-PRC survey and your sorry lot still go on about Kiesling's State Department estimate. 
 Even after citing the Eurominority reports (while making sure the Arvanitika in Epirus are shown as Albanian) you still have not updated your map of linguistic minorities in Greece to show the Arvanites in Thrace. I mean you fools show half of my island as Arvanite speaking when the language is unfortunately almost entirely lost and despite there being more active speakers in Thrace you don't even show them. So much for """"expertise"""" and respect for the sources.
 You complain that you are misunderstood with respect to your broad use of the color brush in the map of Macedonian Slavic dialects in Greece even when it is pointed out to you that your color maps include areas where there were never any settlements of Slavic speaking villages at all. Then you trivialize objections (""""a few kilometers"""" etc.) and suggest that what you do is perfectly kosher. But when you prepare a similar map of Greek dialects http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Modern_Greek_dialects_en.svg instead of following the same rationale and including areas of minimal use of the Greek language (even if it was in the past and no more - just as you argue for your Macedonian map) you stop at the borders of Greece. Obviously the Greeks in Albania and Bulgaria (I won't bother with the Greek linguistic presence - especially in the past - in the Bitola, Gevgelija and Strumica region as I expect them to be invisible to you) are not worth recording (or maybe they are mute in your pretty little world). What about the Greek speaking Turks still left in Turkey (mainly from Crete and Macedonia as well as the Pontus)? I mean OK, screw the linguistic presence in Turkey before 1922 - you obviously have perverse ideas of what time boundaries to use - but at least respect today's reality. If my grandfather's bilingual generation of Arvanite speakers make half the island of Andros Arvanite should you not indicate the presence of the Greek speaking old-people in Turkey? Your double standards are so blatantly obvious it is not even funny that a person such as you wields so much power in WP. I would not even be bothering if it were not for the fact that lazy academics outside of WP have started using these monstrosities you call maps...

You're right about what was with the Jews in USSR (I'm half Jewish, my mother is Jewish, and my grand-grandpa set in Jail there for a short time for teaching Hebrew), but nevertheless, the Soviets didn't give to Estonians to make pogroms at Jews. By the way, at the days of the Tallin Liberator reburial there were many interviews with Jews from Estonia telling how Estonians murdered their people then. 
All the Jewqish community activities in the 80s and 90s was spoonsored by the Jews, and dont forget in 1987-1989 it was still the Soviet Union.

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.

After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.

In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Generally speaking, a personal site isn't accepted as the only mark of somebody's notability.  A lot of people have personal sites, and they aren't notable for it.  The best thing to do would be to find a couple of other sources about Hammond, talking about his project, and link those; newspaper articles work, as do gallery notices and exhibit reviews.  If you have some kind of print source - an exhibition notice, or a catalogue with a bio - cite that as well.  It's not as easily checked, but it's usually a good mark of notability.

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""". I advise the other editors here that their commitment to NPOV will not be rewarded, because it simply is not shared by everyone here.

 Names 

With regard to Nibhurrereya, the reconstructed form of this name would probably be along the lines of *nib-xuperwə-ˡre:ʕə (Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, Loprieno, 1995).  This reconstruction reflects the neutralization of posttonic vowels and the change /ˡi/ > /ˡe/, which Loprieno indicates occurred early in the new kingdom.

While I'm at it, I'd like to call for the following change to be made (slightly modified from my previous appeal):

The article gives a reconstruction of his name as *tuwt-ʕankh-jama:n. However, the Coptic descendent of twt (""""image"""") is ⲧⲟⲩⲱⲧ indicating that  would have been pronounced something like *tVˡwa:t (Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction, Loprieno, 1995; Die Nominalbildung Des Aegyptischen, Osing, 1976), where V is an undetermined vowel (one of e, a, or u in Tut's time). Likewise `nx (""""living"""") here is an active participle, probably perfective, so the reconstruction of this should be *ʕa:nəx, including the effect of posttonic vowel neutralization (Loprieno, 1995). As for """"jama:n"""", Loprieno indicates that the change j > ʔ before an unstressed vowel began in the early Middle Kingdom. This suggests that jama:n was realized as ʔama:n by the time of Tutankhamun.

For sure. The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It's just trolling behavior.  What's up, Doc? 

I'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!
Oh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   
His IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. 
Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   

So according to you, it's enough to only """"suspect"""" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you """"suspect"""", how sure is that?! why didn't you even """"wonder"""", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!

I added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   

 Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)

Luckily these morons only know about two celebs I work for, and NONE of my clients could care less about wiki.  What we all care about is the link to the official site so the option for true and relevant information is available to them.  We don't have time to play the wiki-troll game.   So, YES, you can see the history of this omnitroll, and that username was created JUST for editing those two pages.  I expect the user terminated, and the connecting profiles to be found and terminated.  You can see the moronic trail they left in the history, regardless of username.  It's all the same trolls.

Again, we could care less about anything this site offers, but if information of my clients is going to be posted, the link to the official pages MUST be included.

See to it that the links are NEVER removed, and you will NEVER see me again.  Simple as that.

 WTF?! want != need 

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

 Query 

I suppose I should have taken the point better when you made it here. This is neither a challenge, a complaint, nor a whine, or an attempt to """"gotcha"""" but a ood–faith question and a related comment on which I'd like your observations.
Question: John Bapst Memorial High School 2005 was nominated — not by me — and subsequently deleted yesterday under A7. (I think that's the one, not being a sysop — ahem () — I can't go back to look to make sure.) The entire text of the article was something like, """"Composed of people born in 1986 and 1987. Said to be the best class to ever graduate from this school."""" As I understand from the discussions at Talk:CSD, an indication of importance or significance is credible if it is plausible, even if it is vague and unsupported. That school's class of 2005 could, in fact, have been the best to graduate from that school in many different ways: highest GPA, most athletic championships, fewest teenage pregnancies, or in a 5–year retrospect, most graduates to be admitted to Ivy League schools. None of that is, of course, probably what the creator meant, which was probably nothing more than chauvinistic chest–thumping (but we must AGF). Was that an indication of importance or significance such that the article should not have been A7 nominated or deleted on that basis?
Comment: If I were to start declining A7 speedy noms by strictly applying the criteria you set out at my RfA nomination, viz """"A7 simply does not apply if there is any credible indication of importance or significance"""", then I have the suspicion that at my next RfA nomination, if I choose to try again (and your responses here may help me decide whether or not I will do so), that I may have a hoard of opposers claiming that I'm perverting the CSD process by glibly dismissing valid CSD nominations. I'm concerned that by working on CSD nominations at all that I'm stuck between the battle lines drawn by the deletionists and the inclusionists. If I have any remaining desire for the mop, wouldn't it be better to just avoid CSD altogether?

 Lou Dobbs and Glen Beck believe what you put on """"the fringes"""" not just what you say is """"more mainstream"""" so you're wrong on that one. We already have it established that people have formed conspiracy theories around this and the article establishes that main stream types believe. The article also establishes that people think it's nutso. The introduction is not the place to include all of that and it already mentions that it is part of some conspiracy theories in the intro. Basically there's no point in including any of this. I said before my issue is not with the information in the article, but where it is put and the wording used. Addressing one won't address the other. One article calling it an urban legend is also not sufficient to include the wording.

To begin with, there are an abundance of sources that clearly say that the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights were occupied in 1967 and remain occupied to this day. The usage of """"disputed territory"""" is POV, it reflects the extreme minority view that these territories are not occupied and disregards the overwhelming majority of sources that say that it is. This is the chosen language of the right wing of the Israeli political spectrum, and it is not in compliance with NPOV to use it in the encyclopedia's narrative voice.

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate.

July 28-2011.

What Is Multiculturalism?

Definition: The doctrine that several different cultures (rather than one national culture) can coexist peacefully and equitably in a single country. Therefore, these types of societies can also be described as Plural societies/cultures. Then what does these types of societies have to do to ensure that all ethnic/cultural groups get along well, without strife, hatred, partisanship, or stereotyping? 

If the concept of Multiculturalism is truly going to work for the benefit of the entire commonweal, then the national policies must ensure there is equity in economic opportunities, job opportunities, educational opportunities, and the acquisition open to all. Political affiliation and association allowed to all, freedom of the press, TV, Internet, radio, and other media to all, and judicial representation or habeas Corpus for all who need or seek it.

All Are Supposedly Equal Except Others?

In some societies if you are not a member of the major ethnic or racial group, then you are socially, politically, and sometimes considered a second class citizen. This is overtly and covertly enforced via educational quotas, regional developmental quotas in funding programs, that cater to those second class citizens, and are treated socially as inferiors.

In the EU, and most of the other European countries currently, there is a growing trend to see all immigrants, especially Immigrants Of Color, Arabs/Muslims, as a threat to the stability of those countries. Some states within the union have already legislated against these immigrants, specifying that they wear certain attire in public places, or state owned institutions, and seek to integrate into the mainstream culture in order to be accepted.  

Right Wing Fanaticism:

This idea promulgated by the above groups, that Whites/Caucasians are the only ones who are qualified to occupy Europe is gaining momentum. And that all foreigners to the European hemisphere are not welcomed to reside therein, without the expressed permission of the state concerned. Exceptions are those on holiday, diplomats, and other technocrats that are allowed to reside therein. And marriage between Europeans and non-Europeans must not be allowed or permitted.

 The debate appears to be skewed. 

It is true that geological studies show changes of the environment that contradicts the strong Gaia hypothesis of ecosystems working towards an optimum state. It is also true that there is evidence that ecosystems have collapsed from within. However, the frequency of such ecosystem collapses through geological history is many orders of magnitude lower than the extremely high frequency predicted by the Malthusian model of maximum reproduction. So evolution must be driven by something other than maximization of reproduction. The selfish gene model (the theoretical mechanism basis of the Medea hypothesis of life destroying itself) appears to be supported by simple computer simulations, but so does strong Gaia hypothesis. The strong Gaia hypothesis failed scale-up to more complex systems, and the missing frequency of Medean ecosystem collapses can be explained if the selfish gene model also fails scale-up to the greater complexity of real life because real life is too complex to be livable to such rigid, unselfcritical entities as the selfish gene model claims that living organisms are. In other words, the selfish gene model is based on the same methodological error as is the strong Gaia hypothesis. This is explained in greater detail on the pages """"Moderating the Gaia/Medea debate"""" and """"Self-organization"""" on Pure science Wiki, a wiki devoted to the scientific method unaffected by academic prestige obsession.

It is even more important here than for the rest of the article that the text be accessible. Consideration should be given to creating interest in reading the whole article.In general, specialized terminology should be avoided in an introduction. Where uncommon terms are essential to describing the subject, they should be placed in context, briefly defined, and linked. The subject should be placed in a context with which many readers could be expected to be familiar. For example, rather than giving the latitude and longitude of a town, it is better to state that it is the suburb of some city, or perhaps that it provides services for the farm country of xyz county. Readers should not be dropped into the middle of the subject from the first word; they should be eased into it. It doesn't matter which List guideline you look at, they all refer back to WP:LEAD.

Aristotle himself called the Spartans a monarchy numerous times in the Politics.  I don't understand why you keep trying to call them a republic.  Furthermore, your comments above don't seem any improvement to me on the language in the article now, which is very clear that republics come in many shapes and sizes (in fact, limiting them all to two so-called models seems more restrictive to me than it should be).  Use of the words """"genus"""" and """"species"""", as I've remarked to you before, is a misapplication of taxonomy to political science.  It may be useful for purposes of casual analogy, but we cannot resort to it in an encyclopedia article, or we will confuse and mislead our readers.  You have yet to demonstrate that any authority refers to a government such as that current in the United Kingdom as a republic.  As noted in this paragraph, Aristotle himself describes Sparta as a monarchy  one in which the monarch held weakened powers, yes, but fundamentally part of the """"monarchy"""" category.  Your ideas have the merit of being an unusual take on republics which has given all of us cause to consider political terminology, but I am afraid your quotations, though well cited, do not appear to me to compel us to accept your two model theory of republics  it's original research, something Wikipedia is not.   20:37, 26 Mar 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

It is important to note, most of these arguments employ one or more logical fallacies. They are often made implying certain claims such as some mystical and unchanging human nature. Other times they are so conservative that they threaten denying what is already possible today, such as organ replacement and robots performing many tasks in an adaptive manner. Some of these arguments use appeals to emotion, not limited to the claim that since there is an inequality between the rich and poor that we should slow down progress.

Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page.

He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

 Answer to my question re: web site for both sides controversial issues 

I'm interested in a wide range of issues.  I tend to be liberal politically and enjoy discussing issues with some conservative friends.  On some issues I have made up my mind but would like to understand the other side.  On other issues, I'd like to get more information or at least a good starting point of the the key points of both sides and places to looks further.  going on an issue-by-issue basis is OK but very time consuming. Also, you get a lot of misleading information by looking at sites that promote their point of view. it would be great if there was a web site that had already done this.  Like having an intelligent person research each issue and then give you a one-page summary like """" Here's the issue, here are the two or three main sides, here's the philisophical underpinning for each side, and here are the main points each side makes, backed up by these references."""" 

examples:

Global warming - Wiki is pretty good
guantanamo
stem cells
big government vs small
tax cuts for wealthy
alternative energy policy
civil liberties
separattion fo church and state.
funding for education
solution to social security

I've noticed many Durham Public Schools pages have extensive yet out of place information on the system's desegregation. This should be on a separate page, namely the [Durham Public Schools] page, which it is. Can I please remove this information from Jordan and Northern's pages?

""""The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued the Durham County Schools for integration of the schools. The Durham County School Board had an integration plan accepted by the Federal District Court in Greensboro in 1968 stating that all high schools and junior high schools would be integrated in the fall of 1969. Due to space limitations and the need to purchase mobile units to accomplish integration at the elementary school level, the Federal District Judge in Greensboro gave a year delay for the integration of the elementary schools.
The principals of Durham County's high schools were all employed during legal segregation. A lot of discussion took place by whites and African Americans in the Durham community about how successful the process of integration would be in Durham County. Many knew there would be problems at Southern High School, because the Southern High School mascot was the Rebel, and the high school used the rebel flag (later changed to the Spartan). The principal at Southern High School during this time was Sidney Ray.""""

I don't care what anyone's point of view is, but when they make up words like """"hypergyny"""" (which is only used by academic sociologists), the word should at least make common sense and be backed by evidence.  """"Hypergyny"""" fails on both counts.

""""In the U.S., women’s hypergynous tendencies allow higher status men to be functionally polygynous.""""

Why only in the US?  Not only in the US, and not only among humans, but generally, high status males reproduce more.

""""In some cultures, women are expected to marry a spouse who is more economically, socially, or politically powerful. Known as hypergyny, this practice is common in India.""""

This makes it sound odd for women to desire higher status men, while the truth is that this is essentially universal, just as it is universal that men prefer physically attractive women.

""""Though an expected social norm in America, hypergyny is slowly being replaced by isogamy, marriage between equals, and the marrying 'down' of woman. Many anthropologists ascribe this to increased gender equality between women and men.""""

This is pure nonsense.  As I pointed out, it is simply impossible for women on average to marry up.  No evidence is provided for the above statement because it is impossible for it to be true.  The above is simply a lie designed to make it sound like feminism in America has promoted equality, when nothing could be further from the truth.

My point of view, which probably does not belong in Wikipedia, is that feminism has caused American women to become sluts, having lots of sex with high status men outside of marriage and ignoring men of their own status.  I can also reference academic papers backing up this point of view.  If the section on """"hypergyny and isogamy"""" is to remain, then I should be free to add a section expressing my point of view.

  

Ah, here's the thing: You cannot edit Wikipedia based on """"what you know.""""  All content has to be drawn from reliable sources, which a scholarly journal certainly is.  Whether it's an academic term or not is irrelevant to whether it belongs in the article.  
Just as an aside, arguing against peer-reviewed published works on the use of the hypergyny concept on the basis that """"you know differently"""" is not going to work here. I do agree with you though that some better sources are necessary for the statements in the second paragraph.  

The only source sited in the whole section is a book review published on the web, not an academic paper with peer review.  This is hardly a reliable source.

If the term """"hypergyny"""" is going to be used, it should be made clear that it is an term of academic sociologists, and not a term in general use.  And there should be at least one reference to a truly reliable source containing the term.

I just noticed that the second paragraph of this section is a copy of a blog entry.

  

If someone wants to replace this text, there are numerous reliable sources that use the term hypergyny.  One of the sources I gave above would probably work.  We do agree, however, on the need for sources and the second paragraph, which fails WP:Vthough I'm pretty sure the blog took from Wikipedia, not the other way around.  I'm not really clear on why it matters whether JoeJohn Q. Public uses the term or not; it's not like we do this with articles relevant to physics, geology or biology.

 Your moves of turtle pages 

Was wondering why you made a series of changes to the turtle pages. I am assuming it was for common names, but the names you used are ambiguous at best. The Dinner plate turtle has not been referred as such commonly for decades, the Northern Snapping turtle has several common names of equal usage. The Northern snake neck is more commonly referred to as the northern long neck, etc. These species were better off under their scientific names.

speaking of bad faith...
Reverting edits made in good faith immediately after they are made is irritating and hostile to collaboration. Especially when you obviously don't take the time to consider their reasons. Please explain to me why this quote:
""""The Executive Branch shall construe [the torture ban] in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.""""
Needs to be included in addition to (and immediately following) this quote:
 The executive branch shall construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power, which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President, evidenced in Title X, of protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks. Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action. Finally, given the decision of the Congress reflected in subsections 1005(e) and 1005(h) that the amendments made to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, shall apply to past, present, and future actions, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in that section, and noting that section 1005 does not confer any constitutional right upon an alien detained abroad as an enemy combatant, the executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the Federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future action, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in section 1005.

I don't mind, but I moved your comments to my talk page instead. No, most Egyptians are not aware of Afrocentrism; it would probably never occur to them. However, most Egyptian Americans are aware because of its popularity in the African American community. Egyptians in general who encounter it often react with disbelief, dismissal, annoyance or they just don't care. With regard to being regarded as Caucasian, yes and no, it varies. Personally, I take  issue with Egyptians being described as either white or Caucasian, even though this is how the US classifies them. I know that many Egyptians, especially Egyptian Americans, would also take issue with this classification. And, yes, they consider themselves African basically; it's just not as important for them as it may be to other African communities or African Americans.

Why are Egyptians offended by Afrocentrism? Mostly because Afrocentrism to them is a form of cultural appropriation. Since most Egyptians are not black, Afrocentrists expend much energy to explain that in ways that distance Egyptians from their history. Most Egyptians take pride in their heritage, and Afrocentrism is often perceived as an attempt to """"disinherit"""" them in a way. Egyptians are sensitive both about their present and their past. There is also a perceived racism toward modern Egyptians inherent in Afrocentric thought; in particular, the spurious claim that ancient Egyptian civilization collapsed when the Egyptians supposedly became biologically or """"racially"""" """"diluted"""" by foreign invasion (an idea to which Eurocentrists/White supramicists also hold dearly). I should probably add that over the years there has been occasional tension between the Egyptian American and African American communities in general, e.g. during cultural exhibits and similar events  a relationship that is otherwise quite amicable and will hopefully continue as such.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

This is a short list of users whose pages I found provocative. No one has questioned their neutrality, even thought the content of their pages heavily implies they view Wikipedia as a battleground and are most probably inserting their point of view in their edits. Unfortunately, I refrain from inserting mine, since facts and history back my ideology.

Easy, GIPU.
Okay, I just saw, what I guess is a camera phone capturing the second trailer. It's ultimate influenced again. Ultimate Venom. We see Peter talking to some older person—a chick, I think. Maybe Eddie's mom or something—about the suit and that """"it can take you over"""". Technically, the symbiote forming over Peter's suit, but only enough to change the color is a big hint. Topher's Eddie refers to himself as """"Edward Brock, Junior"""" as he goes into a church asking that Peter Parker be killed. He's really distrought and Topher plays it great. The phone capture guy moves his phone down. *belltower* Capture guy's phone is back up after seemingly missing the bondage and we see it...him...them. Venom, in all its massove glory. Compared to Eddie, it's huge. We can only assume he somehow gets more of the stuff on him than Parker to make up for the added mass just like before, I guess Peter's regular suit protected him from the symbiote's mutative qualities as well. It can be found a bit larger here: ]http://s79.photobucket.com/player_local.swf?file=http://vid79.photobucket.com/albums/j144/duende_verde/duende_comic-con2006_spidey3.flv&refURL;=http://photobucket.com/&ap;=1]

 A great and grand success.... 

  Moment of Joy! What brought me to Wikipedia was the lack of information in the article of Meera. In mid-April 2012, after spending nearly 3 and a half months, I planned to add to those article which are seldom edited by others. Those included the Nawabs of Bengal & Murshidabad, articles related to it and soap opera articles. Soap operas are ongoing so I have to edit them daily but the article on the Nawabs is a piece of history...and I took up the work alone. Later, in May some editors helped me to fix typos and grammatical errors, but soon withdrew back their help. But, by God's grace I finished with the work today on 4 August 2012 and would love to share this success with you! My condition was same as the flying man in the pic, trying to catch a several things at the same time before it's too late. I don't know whether he succeeds or not, bu I did succeed! However, I still have to add some references and summarize the plots of soap opera articles in the soap opera articles. If you want, then you can help. Thank you for all who helped me all these days...thank you again! (২০১২)

88697,ed480a9ec6e8a10b,"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles. Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

Status, let me ask you somethingwhere do you think these budget quotes you put up as gospel come from?  They come from people at these websites evaluating the information available to them.  Nobody ever calls them from the studio and says """"Okay, here's what we spent on this movie.""""  They do not like that information to be widely available.  In their perfect world, nobody would know what they spent on their moviesthey'd announce a preliminary figure before one frame of film was shot, and no matter how much higher the actual expenses went, that's what people would quote.  But we're curious to know, and it's part of how we decide how well (or poorly) a given film did, so in the very rare event that somebody directly at the center of financing a given film says """"Budget was Mid-30's"""", that's actually a big deal to a site like box office mojo.  They take that very seriously, and they will use that to base a budget estimate onknowing full well that's not the exact figure, and neither they nor any other website will ever have the exact figure.  No movie ever costs exactly 10 million, 20 million, 100 million, etc.  It's always approximate.  It's never exact.  And it's usually lowballed, because studios want people to think they made more money than they really did (or in this case, that they lost less money than they really did).  Now you can see I haven't edited the budget info for this movie in days, so what exactly is your problem here?

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld.

Thank Caniago for providing a clearer direction for me as a new contributor. Certainly it is much clearer than previous message that I got.

Please allow me to quote < 1 KB   If an article or list has remained this size for over a couple of months, consider combining it with a related page.Actually I got the idea after looking at Sidoarjo which has subdistrict information like I did. But, then I extended it further with the village information. Since my daily work does not related to that information of course I have to build it from scratch. However, I did as careful as I can. I always use pertinent information or previous works (for instance Sidoarjo) as reference.

KNM, I am convinced that MagicMiracle is right in what he/she is saying. The NRN controversy is definitely not absolute. {Reference: Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikipedia principle. According to Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, NPOV is """"absolute and non-negotiable.""""[1]} Moreover, it is a direct attack on a public figure without legal justification.

To adopt your analogy, Ed Johnston is the systems manager guy in the wikioffice, with seniority, wide knowledge of the way it best functions, and a demonstrated capacity for making judgements all sides accept as neutral, and he's telling a less experienced wikipedian how this peculiar society works.  Most serious, professional writers, scholars and thinkers find this place exasperating and refuse to help out. Some just learn to bite the bullet, wear the bullshit, adapt to suppressing the 'Ah, you fucken dopey arsehole' sort of thought that passes one's article-parsing mind from hour to hour, and write instead, 'you're mistaken' or even 'you screwed up'. Of course there are lots of ignoramuses and liars here, like everywhere in the world and in every sphere of activity. Here, the rule is, if you want to lie or push a POV against the evidence, as long as you stick to the AGF rules, you can enjoy longevity while enjoying exhibitions of suicide by people who call you out. That looks outrageous, at first glance, but without it, tens of thousands of quite good quality articles on difficult and controversial topics would never have been written. Anthropologists, when studying a tribe in field research, understand that they must adapt, provisorily, to the rules of the tribe: back in their professorial armchair, a different discourse obtains which, were it thrown the tribe's way would (a) only be offensive (b) obstruct the acquisition of a tribe's ethnography and (c) ultimately, be detrimental to the tribe itself, which down the line may well need that expert's return to assist it in adapting in turn to a larger world outside of its own mental confines.

 REAL Women of Canada: You changed the description fropm """"social conservative"""" to """"conservative"""". The organization's website addresses only social issues, and not economic ones, therefore it is appropriate to describe it as """"social conservative"""". If you want to change that description to """"conservative"""", you must provide evidence.

Shorne, sorry to break it to you, but referring to the Holodomor  and the famines in Russia in general  as a holocaust does not diminish the holocaust against the Jews. Unless, of course, you wish to say that eliminating the social class of peasants is in some way trivial, and hence it would trivialize the killing of the Jews as an ethnic group by association. 

Calling the holodomor and the related events a holocaust rather puts those events in the right perspective: there WAS both CALLOUS and deliberate killing of the undesired class during the holodomor that was NOT principally ANY different from the shoa. Have a look at Hannah Arendt's writings and you will see what I mean. 

However, from your comments regarding the alleged 'bias' against left-wing pov's here, I assume that you are in fact somewhat of a Soviet apologist. Since I am myself a social-democrat, I can't say that there is any kind of bias against left-wing POV's here. Rather, there seems to be a fortunate tendency towards limiting both right-wing and left-wing extremism. Or, in other words, wikipedia seems to have adopted a cultural most befitting to an open society, and rather hostile towards totalitarian ideas. 

How fortunate.

 Vienna 

Dude, seriously.  WP:RS and WP:V don't get thrown out the window just because Mary Jo Foley of microsoft-watch.com provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a so-called """"spokesman"""" about the change in name.  Nobody at Microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say """"Yes, the name is Vienna"""" in the last few days.  Doesn't that strike you as somewhat odd?  We can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team, or a page on Microsoft's web site.  Not this time.  I'm not going to bother with renaming back to Windows Blackcomb, since you'll probably change it back to Vienna without bothering with that nagging Wikipedia requirement of verifiability.  This isn't a race.  
Okay... What's the point of these constant reverts back to Blackcomb? I'm really sure now that the codename is """"Vienna"""". The change was recent, let's not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. No offense, but you seem to like the name Blackcomb much better than Vienna. Get over it. It was changed. Now it wasn't only Scoble who confirmed it. My guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. Several sources claim it's """"Vienna"""", so let's keep it that way. There were rumours about """"Longhorn"""" being changed to """"Vista"""", but later it was confirmed. Let's just leave the article alone for right now. —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

158728,f290884e72efefe6,"This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”
I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Waterfalls 
Hamilton looks like an impressive place for waterfalls.  I""""ll certainly have to include it in my list of places to visit.  I can't speak for any of the areas in the Pacific Northwest (which is home to hundreds of high, impressive falls), in North Carolina, according to Kevin Adams' """"North Carolina Waterfalls: A Hiking and Photography Guide"""", our state is estimated to have around 1,000 - 1,500 falls in the state, most of them in Transylvania County, NC (aka """"The Land of Waterfalls"""").  Estimates are that TC contains between 400-500 """"major"""" waterfalls in an area slightly smaller than the City of Hamilton (390 sq mi versus Hamilton's 439 sq mi).  As for what you call """"major"""" - that's pretty much up to the viewer.  One man's gushing torrent is another man's damp spot on the side of a rock.  In TC, a major waterfall is usually considered at least 15-20' high - not including talus - or having enough current to be an obvious waterfall (such as Hooker Falls).

If you ever get the chance to visit NC, please do.  We've got a lot of beautiful, rugged country.  To this day, I get reports about new waterfalls discovered by people who are just now able to scamper through some of the roughest terrain the east coast has to offer.    

Part of the problem with defining the """"City with the most waterfalls"""" is that neither term is overly well defined.  """"City"""" can mean """"town limits"""" or """"Metropolitan Area"""" or any other of a dozen different definitions.  Then you have the problem with the exact definition of a waterfall.  Ergo, you have the problem.   

Trail in New Zealand
I don't know of another town with that many waterfalls.  However I do know that when it rains really heavily the valley that you walk up first on the Milford Track, has over 300 waterfalls. -

Regarding the 100 waterfalls Hamilton, I am unaware of another city area with that many.  There are probably """"areas"""" with about that much, such as the Columbia River Gorge, but the exact number there I am ignorant of and they are not that many major ones.  Here on the Olympic Peninsula we have a number of falls, but it is a really large area and probably does not reach the density that you have indicated there in Hamilton.  However it must be noted that I am a amateur at this and am ignorant of much

However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it!

As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!).

I cited the account of Dionysios Thrax which proves the mediae were fricatives but the advocates of the reconstructed pronunciation knowing that it demolished their theory erased it.   I cited the inscriptional record which is the basis of Caragounis research and the dishonest advocates of the reconstructed pronunciation erased that too. And once again you have shown that you have no grasp whatsoever of Semitic linguistics since I have told you often enough that proto-Semitic had both fricative and non-fricative forms of b, d and g (β, δ, γ) as well as f, t, k (φ, θ, χ) which were represented in Phoenician script by letters which were allophones for both. The fricative and non-fricative versions of these sound still existe today in Arabic but in Hebrew the original proto-Semitic fricative became breaths and the non-fricative became fricatives long before Hellenistic times.  

As for these sounds in other indo-European languages. Grimm got it wrong as I have prove in the discussion here. . These sounds were originally fricatives since that is the only way German could have undergone the changes it underwent without the sounds of the psila, mediae and dasea being confused.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

What if the beam started lower, if the beam, was closer the the S, would more mass go to the S, would there be a point, where it would not split anymore? How many people repeated this experiment?
Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist.

To follow up, I am very sympathetic indeed to your project to add the names of distinguished biologists and biological educators. If you'll check what I do around here, you'll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects.  But there are some difficulties. I can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on John Tyler Bonner was nominated about 6 months ago for speedy deletion as """"did not assert notability"""" and fortunately rescued. About one member of the US National academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at AfD a month. They all get kept, but it takes work. 

What is needed for a successful article on a researcher is:
A short bio listing the birth, degrees, positions. 
A paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as important
A list of books, & a few major articles. When challenged, I add the number of citations for the most-cited. 
A list of awards and honors and editorships . 
I've been adding grants received. 
if possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier  after they have died. 
and of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site, tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. 
Pictures, as you've discovered, add problems. I usually dont try. 
This works if: the person was a full professor at a recognized research university, and has an award or  two from outside the university. Otherwise there are problems; people at non-research places need very solid documentation. Professors of education need really solid documentation. 
 
For educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition, and at least one more than the president of NABT will in general be necessary. We have so far not had very good success herevery few high school teachers have made it past AfD. Good luck, and call on me for any help. ''''''  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 This info is all messed up !! 

Pit bull is a slang term that describes several types of dogs with similar physical characteristics. There are several physically similar breeds that are often termed """"pit bull"""", including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the Perro de Presa Canario, Cane Corso, and Argentine Dogos.These breeds are usually not included by name in any Breed Specific Legislation (see below), but are sometimes included because of a broad definition and confusion as to what a pit bull actually is. [1] All of these breeds as well as many others (including Great Danes, Newfoundlands and Rottweilers) are members of the Molosser family of dog breeds.

1: Pitbull is NOT a slang , its just one of the nicknames och shortened names the breed has had during the years.
Those that use it for dogs other then Pitbulls are just ignorant and dont have the facts surrounding the breed clear to them.
often used by journalists and people without any background info
Its a pure breed dog , registered under UKC since 1898. its beeing registered under """"American pitbull Terrier"""" under a few more registrys such as ADBA & BFKC in USA.

I dont know why this site, that is set to be some kind of """"kowledge base"""" allows itself to have this info at the top of the page.
All it does, is to confuse people that come in here to read and to find out more about the breed.

If this is the first thing a visitor reads , then it often sticks to his/her mind as """"truth"""" and he leaves the site.
If a reader comes in here to search facts because he/her is unsure about what a Pitbull is because of medias coverage, then this info just confirmes to him/her that there is no such thing as a real Pitbull, with is as far from the truth you may come.
There are so many myths and hearsays around this breed , so i suggest the top info to be rewritten and only contain FACTS.

Many countries have their own Kennelclubs , and they are all tied together by FCI as an international organ.
But FCI only works with 1 kennelclub per country and if a dog aint listed in that club , other countries follow FCI regulations and do the same.
This is why FCI dossent recognize the Pitbull as a pure breed.
They work with AKC (American Kennel Club) that dossent keep register of the Pitbull , But the American Staffordshire Terrier.
Pitbulls as i said erlier,  was first registered with UKC (United Kennel Club) and because only one club per country is allowed in FIC regulations the Pitbull was left outside due to a tecnicality.

This is the same in several countries.
The national kennelclubs is tied to follow FCI regulations if they are members , and thats why Sweden for example dossent recognize the pitbull in their own kennel klub (SKK).

Why did i say all this then ?
Well , it goes back to what i wrote erlier.
If a person think that Pitbull just is a """"slang"""" and not a pure breed as written at top of Wikipedia site about pitbulls , and lives in Sweden for example , then this sites info add more to the myths.

So if a moderator reads this , please think hard about what signals the top text about Pitbulls sends out to this pages viewers.

Some of this discussion seems to have gotten a little heated, but I think the main goal remains the same of having a good encylopedia and having good articles within it. The subjects involved, both MHFM and the others mentioned - may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theological/philsophical schools of which they represent. The sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of Vatican II on the largest single religious denomination on the planet, and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept Vatican II and those who refuse and resist it (such as the Society of Saint Pius X) but still hold that Francis is a legitimate Pope (despite his endorsement of Vatican II). Due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory Vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post Vatican II Catholicism, and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as """"What will Amanda Bynes tweet next?"""" it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite. But it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought. Surely if wikipedia can have an article on every piece of music made by Paris Hilton, we can find a way to capture the interactions and debates between schools of thought that will continue for generations to come. 

It is Wikipedia practice to use a person's published thoughts as a legitimate source that can be cited as a quotation about that person's opinion...i.e. a person's tweets can be quoted in that person's wikiarticle (citing the twitter page's url) even though they are were not printed in full by a media organization. It would seem that such an approach could be used here citing Ibranyi by quoting his online work as an indication of his own thought, as long as an encylopedic manner was maintained.174.53.163.243  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I agree, its a better picture for the article - my concern is purely on the copyright side of things.

It's a challenge for photographs that might be around 1900+ in date. Where we don't have a photographer's name, it is quite plausible that they may have been taken (say) by a 20 year old, who could easily have lived to seventy, in which case the """"lifetime + 70 years"""" of copyright protection won't run out until 2020+, depending on the exact date of the photo.

Here's a clip from Sedlar's film which shows first issue of the magazine titled """"Ustaša"""" which Pavelić began publishing in the spring of 1930 (skip to 3:13). Although stylized, the header clearly shows an asymmetrical """"U"""" with a bomb in it (symbolizing revolutionary struggle).
At 3:37 in the same clip a magazine cut out showing the UHRO organization logo is shown as printed by them - an asymmetrical """"U"""", a flaming bomb inside it and a chequoy on the bomb. It looks just like the one Nanin7 had made and DIREKTOR removed (bar the dark-blue color which Nanin7 used to fill in the letter U). The original is black-and-white but the letter itself clearly wasn't meant to be black.
At 5:03 in the same clip the front page of the organization's statute is shown, again, with the same logo as described above, dated 1932.
At 5:22 the narrator talks about the organization logo directly and says that """"The """"Ustaša"""" was defined as a revolutionary fighter, also indicated by their logo, which first appeared in the masthead of the magazine """"Ustaša"""" in 1930. Inside a blue letter """"U"""" a silver hand grenade is depicted, with red flames coming out of it. In the centre of the bomb a small Croatian coat of arms is shown, with the top left field in silver."""" As he is saying that yet another picture of the logo is being shown (this one seems to be an enamel badge). The text btw was written by one Mario Jareb, a historian who wrote several books on the history of the Ustaše as well as one on the history of Croatian national symbols.
At 5:55 in the same clip front page of yet another party newspaper titled """"Nezavisna država Hrvatska"""" (published in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and San Francisco), with the same logo shown, this time in the form of an initial in the main headline, dated 1 May 1934. 
So I don't know how much more official can it get. As for the """"several variant"""" thing - I can only assume they dropped the bomb once NDH was established (since per their logic, the revolutionary struggle has achieved its goal) and replaced it with just a chequoy which was then used as a state symbol later on. I've never seen a cross in combination in contemporary use, only in modern far-right graffiti, but I may be wrong. Either way, this article is about the Ustaše party/movement and this version is the closest we will ever come to what was their official symbol. Only the shade of the color blue can be considered debatable (I tend to think it was probably lighter blue than what Nanin7 used).  (''talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

We must follow what sources say; if you want to put in a rounded number and make up some error bars, but the source gives an exact number that's a Bad Thing.

Should we show both to readers?

Blame homosexuality, the Vatican's second in command claims.""""
2)  http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html   """"I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along.

Bill from the Catholic League so I think from an objective POV we can say that it has been a crisis of homosexuality with a few other contributing factors but that Celibacy, and Seminary training were not one of them.

I mean that is quite a strong assertion to make don't you think?  the idea that you can blame an institution like the Catholic Seminary for a series of generalized horrific crimes.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

 Dirtiness of thermonuclear bombs 

An unsupported statement is made that """"... the smaller a thermonuclear bomb is, the """"dirtier"""" it is ...""""
This is misleading, if not untrue.

Bombs are optimised for an entirely different purpose. It is true that in small and large bombs, the bulk of the yield is from fission, but this is a design decision, and can easily be eliminated by using a non-fissile tamper material. The secondary of a small multi-stage bomb is just another boosted fission stage, fusion yield negligible. The largest bomb ever tested (~50MT) was fairly clean, but only because the fissile tamper was removed from the secondary to reduce contamination. Small ultra-clean bombs have also been tested.

The article is about the current art of laser-driven ICF. Fission-driven ICF was the first mechanism used and has been proven, so a summary definitely belongs here. The details of using large explosions for power belong in another more general nuclear power article.

 Wahabi and terrorism 

I have added this heading with neutral and verifiable sources which is most missing point from this Article.

Wahabi relationship with Terrorism
Wahabism,Saudi Arabia’s dominant faith is an austere form of Sunni Islam and Its explosive growth began in the 1970s when Saudi charities started funding Wahabi schools and mosques.[22] Professor Bernard Lewis, a leading scholar of Islam, has noted that the Wahhabis are to Islam what the Ku Klux Klan is to Christianity. They can be accused of hijacking Islam.[23]
The Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World.The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, have been inspired by Wahabism[24]. The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah-e-Sahaba and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan).[25] Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed, and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq, and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia. Once its followers took power, they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia. For example, the secessionist war in Eritrea (1958-1991), which was designed to make Ethiopia land-locked, was largely financed by Saudi Arabia. Likewise, Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977- 1978. The Saudi authorities may deny this, but it is widely documented. [26]
[edit]In Pakistan

The JamatudDawah ,Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Lashkar-e-Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements .These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names. Arab states especially Saudi Arabia and GCC states have been funding extremist Deobandi and Wahabis in Pakistan, since the Afghan Jihad.Pakistan has became a battleground between Saudi Arabia funded Deobandi and Wahabis and Iran funded Shia causing deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims.[27],
[edit]In India

Wahhabism, an austere, puritanical interpretation of Islam promoted by Saudi Arabia, is making deep inroads into Kashmir due to the efforts of the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, which calls itself a religious and welfare organisation.Kashmir's non-Muslim minority, too, views the Wahhabi ingress as a """"conspiracy to Talibanise Kashmir"""". """"The Taliban had also sprung from Pakistani madrassas funded by the Wahhabis,"""" says former Kashmir University professor Kashi Nath Pandita. [28]

These all seem to be reasonable solutions, if a little stop-gappy.  I think my problem is that I am seeing this as an outsider to this UK group and the UK group might be seeing the article as a group of insiders writing for insiders.  My initial problem with the article was that it is unclear and allows different incompatible readings.  """"Administrative geography"""" certainly makes the article more consistent, but I'm not sure it makes the title more understandable (unless, of course, you are a geographer or know all the branches of geography).  To benefit neophytes (perhaps I presume too much in thinking this is the intended audience of wikipedia and any other encyclopedia articles) on the subject which this article addresses, I would make the following suggestions.  1) Gut as much of the introduction as possible regarding the four countries and, instead, refer people to that article (since it already exists; which would also resolve some problems people have with repetition between these two articles.  2) Explain what """"administrative geography"""" addresses (e.g., national and local government hierarchies) and how this relates to this article.  3) For the love of God, rename (to whatever is appropriate) the section entitled """"In the UK"""" (or eliminate this title) because it serves no purpose whatsoeverperhaps to """"contemporary administration"""" or something that transitions from """"History""""; although for reasons beyond my comprehension, some people are apparently wedded till death to that vacuous phrase (i.e., In the UK).  4) Move the last paragraph of the Intro (beginning with """"Historically..."""") to the History section or exapnd on the themes it introduces. 5) Identify the referent of """"This structure"""" in the History section (i.e., answer the question, """"What structure?"""").  6) Follow strict style guidelines for the terms """"division[s]"""" and """"subdivision[s]"""" throughout this article if either is a significant concept for this article.  7) Incorporate the """"Parliamentary representation"""" section into the section preceding it.  This would give a structure of [Introduction], History, Contemporary Administration (or whatever), Informal (Sub)Divisions, International (Sub)Divisions. As things stand, having a separate section for informal divisions suggests the rest of the article is about formal divisions, which would be fine if the sections reflected a more transparent and sensible organization to the article currently lacking.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda.

Notability of MR.King Of Fighters
A tag has been placed on MR.King Of Fighters, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

You are bizarre and a knob.
You're a terrible bum and a snob.
You're a simian loser,
A malodorous boozer,
And a boob and a fiend and a slob.

You are insane and a brat.
You're a miscreant mule and a prat.
You're a rube and a dog,
An unscrupulous hog,
And your mind is redundant and fat.

You are a putz and a mule.
You're a fool and a goob and a tool.

A bum and a rube,

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:
""""However, a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. The fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial; Grossman's personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.""""
""""Ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an impressive, enormous body of work...""""
""""At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman's designs are available.""""
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don't see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V. Personally, I always find it useful to look at several featured articles to get an idea of the kind of standards I should be aiming for.

ahh now you're really showing the love here and not a single piece of that """"wikipedia isn't the place for you"""" mumbo jumbo. guess Travian is not the only one who has changed his attitude a bit now eh?

the following is to my fellow blockee magog: 

yes you may make some suggestions my fellow gentleman D you may be happy to know that ive read them even before i joined wiki and ive read them just now just because you asked so nicely here are the replys in an orderly fashion please take the time to read it my dear sir
 
1. i understand the battleground thing was just a show of enthusiasm we'll get to that in a minute
2. now i dont have a mother(or parents for that matter) but i know where you are getting at: dont try to hurt other peoples feelings or as you may put it or potty it ;)  dont be a potty mouth
3. ( now this is the part Travian has a little problem with i feel that you should have been a wee bit more lenient with me on my first block(not this one) you should have warned me before blocking since it was my first time anyway but i guess blocking all those other vandals has some kind of a PTSD effect on wiki admins dont worry ill make the explanation short  please tolerate Travian he only made 4 reverts he was warned ONLY once for reverting 3 times and at that time he didnt check his talk page so he didnt know if he had a warning as he was busy browsing but that wasnt a violation it was a fair warning no doubt but... at that exact time i was going to modify my 4th edit(it was not a revert) so naturally i wouldnt be able to see the warning i only saw the orange message after i finished editing and saved the page after i did that i got another warning only it wasnt a warning it said that i have been reported for editting 4 times boy did i wish it was a warning though P now i felt that i deserved a warning before i got blocked a warning by YOU yourself we are all guys here arent we (even though im 12 i still do count D ) my point is we are all reasonable men here i would have stopped had i known that i was doing harm and not the good i envisioned. so please i would like to ask you tolerate me of you will ill talk more about this below
4. oh i humbly apologize but its just that that situation was unique that particular user wasnt going to listen anyway but believe me another user spoke to him giving a link to disprove his point but he kept insisting he was right i assumed good faith in that had he seen that link he would not have continued with his points (as he had been reverted by many others before too) but i was clearly wrong on that part so i reverted his edits and he kept reverting mine so i posted a comment on his talk page only to get insulted. i would have welcomed him with the """"welcome to wikipedia"""" thingy with the pretty pictures but alas i had no knowledge of how to do that. but i did make a little mistake though that comment i made may have been a bit personal but it was not an attack no was it insulting but it was accurate notheless and when he insulted me back i thought of ignoring him but knowing that he could easily be aggravated i just couldn't pass this offer up just for the giggles but i know when im guilty regardless of  reason if you may ask why i did it i would answer with IDIFTL D
5.mastodon lol thats funny(did you know scientists are running an extinct cloning program? so the mastodons might indeed be coming back) oh no no my fellow editor you got it all wrong i wasnt really angry i did it for the laughs it was funny even if it was a little bit after all creating a page with """"hairy monkey balls"""" did make me giggle P i hope someone besides me got some laughs ;) but alas i know when ive done something bad read the """"in a nutshell"""" part for details of you are confused

yes ive read them now i cant guarantee that but i promise i will not be a potty mouth k? i cannot guarantee the other part because i may accidentaly edit 4 times in a row but i want you to be a bit lenient with me on this last part now ive seen people right here on wiki who made more than 10 reverts not get immediately bloc",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

The info from the hook has to be present in the article and supported (in the article) with a citation.  Someone will double-check to make sure the source says what it's claimed to say.

Once you've come up with a hook, fill in your username as the author and fill the title of the article, then add the above code, including your hook following the """"hook="""" part, to the top of the appropriate section for the day the article was started on the DYK template talk page.

The grammar has been updated

I took the time to update the grammar and rearrange some of the sentence structure. One person took the time to point out a """"General Discussion"""" web forum that is definitely not official, but I did not delete that information, like I probably should have. Instead, I simply pointed out that Midway's highest ranking authoritytheir CEOhas officially confirmed that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360. Although Epic currently does not acknowledge that they are developing an Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 2007, that definitely does not prevent Midway from Publishing the game for the Xbox 360. 

Midway could easily develop the game for the Xbox 360 on their own, or they could outsource the development to another developer. Let's not forget that the PC is the primary development platform for Unreal Tournament 2007. Midway or an outsourced developer could easily port the game to the Xbox 360 because the Xbox 360 is so easy to program games for, since it is so similar to the PC. However, the Playstation 3 is very difficult to develop games for, and it likely requires skilled developers such as Epic to work on both the PC and PS3 versions at the same time. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Midway CEO David Zucker has made it 100% clear that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360, regardless of who the Developer of the game is.

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

The edit by 166.216.128.16 added mention of """"English and Irish descent"""", but also truncated the long standing paragraph on the fact that Helen Slater is no blood relation to him.  As you observed, the paragraph made no sense after that hack job.

In my opinion, the original paragraph touched on a point of interest, one that people might consult an encyclopedia to confirm or deny, and offered verifiable facts that attest to the extistence of a point of confusion (i.e. co-starring in """"The Legend of Billie Jean"""", and misinformation published on a DVD of """"Supergirl"""").

Now you have reversed my reversal.  I suspect you've done this in reaction to the mutilated version left by 166.216.128.16.  If you review the edit history between say Oct 26 and 29, and appreciate the original (and long standing) version of the paragraph, I leave it to you to bring the article back to that state again, as I'm loathe to reverse the reversal of my reversal.

Thanks for considering this.

  

 Censored Comments on Scorcese
I would appreciate it if you didn't delete my comments on talk pages for personal reasons. No editors were attacked and WP:BLP is for ARTICLES, NOT talk pages.   
Your statement """"there is a contingent of editors that feel the need to hide the fact that there are actually famous people in Hollywood that support child rape"""" is most certainly an attack upon a """"contingent of editors"""" which include the ones who have acted against your campaign to accuse multiple persons of supporting child rape, all the while ignoring the comments regarding reading the actual petition and trying to understand the actual difference between supporting Polanski's actions and protesting the manner in which he was arrested. And for the record, WP:BLP most certainly covers talk pages. See WP:BLP#Non-article space, which says """"Contentious material that is unsourced or poorly sourced and not related or useful to making article content choices should be deleted, and even permanently removed (""""oversighted"""") if especially problematic"""". Both your claim about editors' motivation and your statements against Scorcese are attacks. Please try to contain your bad faith.   

 You guys are delusional. I'm sorry that your celebrity hero worship blinds you to the fact that Roman Polanski raped a child and that is not okay. Maybe you should stop watching so many movies and go outside and watch the sun shine. It's not even worth it anymore. Have fun guarding your precious Hollywood articles from anyone that you slightly disagree with.   

No, delusional is thinking that because someone disputes the manner in which you present your viewpoint, it equates to being in favour of raping children, and that's not the first time you've made that type of comment.  That's delusional.  My disagreement with you is more than """"slight"""".   If I notice you make any comments that go against WP:BLP or that attack editors, I will revert them, but that is the only interraction I ever want to have with you.   Please do not leave any further messages on my talk page, and as long as you don't make any further inflammatory comments, I'll have no reason to bother you.

 Taiwo Atieno II 

Just noticed your question on my talkpage — somehow I'd missed it.  My understanding of the WP convention is that if a player is rostered with a club for any significant period of time, that club is listed in his infobox even if the player makes no appearances for the club.  If a player only passes through briefly and makes no appearances for the club, however, it isn't listed.  As for the other question, I'd say it's fairly common in the US for a player to spend a very brief period on the roster of one club before being traded to another: for instance, in the 2006 expansion draft, expansion franchise Toronto FC snapped up a couple of guys simply for their """"trade value"""" and then proceeded to deal them to other teams in exchange for players they actually wanted.  I believe that in circumstances like this, we wouldn't list a Toronto FC tenure in a player's infobox.  Overall, my understanding of the guidelines here is pretty shakey, to be honest.

But the most supported stance of the 3 (gnostic/anti-gnostic/stance 3) is that the original more gnostic version was doctored (actually quite a lot of people support this idea - Cerinthus was held by some to have been the author, despite the fact that Irenaeus, who makes the first known quotes from John, uses his """"copy"""" of the gospel to attack Cerinthus.

Mark can be seen as gnostic - see the pythagoreanism part for example, re. 153. But in particular, the mysterious naked youth, and thomas didymous which can both easily be seen as gnostic teachings,(n.b. thomas didymous translates into english as twin twin), though I am not going to elaborate on that here, as I will add it to the article at some point. Also, the very existance of Secret Gospel of Mark is gnostic, as well as the reasoning that Clement gives for it's creation, and his statement that the Carpocrations favoured it heavily.

 Your sig... 

I'm curious as to how you're signing off. Are you doing ~~~~, or are you typing it by hand? Your signature should always be linked to your user page, talk page, or both, just as a heads up. 

Also, whilst it's always great to have new vandal fighters, you've been one of the very rare people who go straight into full on vandalfighting straight from creating an account. It's something that we don't tend to recommend because a lot of the tools are really easy to go wrong on. I know when I first used Twinkle I somehow managed to screw that up as well. 

But besides that, I'm sure having one more vandal fighter, regardless how new, is never a bad thing for Wikipedia, right? So my suggestion to you would be to get adopted by a more experienced user. (I'm still learning the ropes myself, and being adopted has been immensely helpful, if only to know that there's people I can go to for help.) Wikipedia is a really hard community to become part of sometimes, and I'm afraid you've been one of those who's had a bit of a rough time getting settled. I hope it does get better for you- and I think getting mentored by someone will help you greatly with that.

We agree that there are human rights that do not appear in any law book, treaty, dictionary, or even a USSC decision. The founders of the US said this, and wrote an expandible constitution. The 14th Amendment reserved to Congress the authority to enumerate these. This happened when Congress enumerated such rights with the Civil Rights Act of 1963 (from the Republican Party) and more recently with the Americans with Disabilities Act. I expect that you will see some more """"enumerations"""" by Congress. The US Constitution is designed with the idea that as society progresses that human rights will continue to be """"enumerated"""". I can remember when there was no right of privacy, but Roe v.

Please change """"irish-born British"""" to """"irish"""" or to """"irish who worked mainly in London"""" because of the following; The  says he was born AND grew up in Ireland apart from a stint in London during WW1. He then went travelling in 1926/1928 to London, Berlin, Paris and back to London. Also, when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did. So he's irish until proven otherwise. Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so. Someone's nationality cannot decided by concensus which is whats happening here. Ignoring the above facts above would be more than disappointing but also from what we KNOW it it is incorrect and an injustice to be so arbitrary. 109.78.211.58  14:05, 11 August 2013""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Re: Hughes.  Yes, I think you're right that they were no longer lovers at that time.  But you didn't change """"was her lover"""" to """"had been her lover,"""" you just deleted the entire paragraph, which I dispute.  Instead, I propose:  With the help of Howard Hughes, who at one time had been her lover, she purchased the rights to the play and turned it into a hit movie.  The movie was very important to her career and it's an interesting and pertinent detail that Hughes was so involved in helping her make it a reality.  I certainly don't want to perpetuate errors, but let's talk about how to fix them instead of just deleting information wholesale.

Re: Hepburn and Tracy's living situation  what would you suggest instead?  How about something like... Hepburn and Tracy were undeniably a couple, but only lived together regularly until the last few years of Tracy's life. Even then, they maintained separate homes to keep up appearances.

Re the Hughes/Hepburn engagement  I believe there was a NYT article that announced their engagement, or announced that it was off, but I haven't had time yet to find it.

Re Hepburn and Smith's marriage, from Higham:  The marriage was a disaster. Kate had such a horror of domesticity that the whole experience was a nightmare. She evidently realized that she had married on a whim and that marriage was totally incompatible with her need for absolute freedom of thought and action.  Three weeks after the marriage took place, the couple separated.  Faced with the fact that he had a failed marriage, Luddy sensibly decided to continue with Kate on a platonic basis.  She remained legally married to him for several years.  Do you have something that refutes this?  I'd be glad to source it specifically to Higham in the text of the article if you like.

This entry's game-plot/storyline is longer than the combined entries for the plot/storylines of all three movies.  A few hundred fans of the game may care about its story, but this sort of overly detailed plot exposition doesn't belong in a Wikipedia article.  Smells like fans trying to save a dying game.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
I agree, though before seeing this section I was going to suggest splitting it off into a separate article to satisfy those who disagree. I think we need a little more discussion and consensus before coming to a decision, however.  t 

Honestly I don't there is any need to """"satisfy"""" anyone who is not content with it.  The cruft is barely (if at all) notable enough to be in this article.  Never mind its own.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I don't think obvious personal bias against this (or any game for that matter) should be a motivator for any article changes.    —Preceding comment was added at  

The obvious personal bias of a few overzealous gamers is the reason the article's so bloated with trivial data to begin with.  I'm with Ookami, this game just plain isn't notable enough to warrant a chapter by chapter breakdown of its storyline.  That's what fan sites are for.   

Just checked the World of Warcraft page out of curiosity, and even it doesn't have this much detailed story description.  In fact it barely has any, and I don't think anyone can argue which of the two games is more notable.  Also someone further up the page here brought this issue up already under 'generic story', why is this still being allowed?  

I play this game, I could care less that the huge exposition was taken out. That was an absolutely ridiculous story summary; most of the people that play the game couldn't tell you half of it. However, to kill the previous, argument, WoW barely has a story, while the Matrix Online's main content and selling point is the story. We don't need a 20 paragraph summary like before. A mention that there have been past live events, as well as a 4 sentence or so story summary, should suffice. I'd challenge one of you to do it, as I don't think any of you know anything about the game in the current state, besides that it is much weaker than World of Warcraft.   
To clarify my point above, I think the storyline section is very good now, it does, however, need the slightest mention of what has happened.   

Just for clarification, the game's main selling point was not the story itself, but that the players would be shaping the story, which never happened.  And WoW has plenty of story, enough to fill reams of Wikipages, it's just that it doesn't belong here in that great of detail.  This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a novel.  

Well, since there seems to be some rough consensus that this is well overdone, and that there has been no real objection to it, and pending the fact that no one with the adequate experience within the game has stepped forward to trim it down and keep whatever are the key points, I'm going to purge it.Talk|@ 
Per the anon-IP user's objection in the page history of the main article...  It doesn't matter.  Its that simple.

 African Americans are multiracials 
Countless studies and research have shown that African Americans aren't pure blacks, like you would find in Africa, but multiracials. They have Native American and Caucasoid in their ancestry, from being raped and what have you. Technically speaking, they are a completely separate race from """"Black people"""", as they aren't pure blacks. The only reason they're often categorized as such is because of the One-Drop rule. Shouldn't this fact be noted in the heading of the article. At least something about them being multiracials as opposed to pure blacks? 66.175.204.183    —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.175.200.14   

That's because """"race"""" varies over a fairly smooth space of variable phenotypes and two races are described as different when there is a discontinuity.  That is to say, before civilized times, one was not really able to tell the difference between one's neighbors, and one was rather unlikely to encounter people who looked substantially different until more modern and effective means of transportation and higher population densities allowed for it.  Your views on racial mixing """"creating a new race"""" is bizarre, since it takes race to be an immutable and discrete classification system.  This is the same kind of fallacy that leads one to ask for the """"missing link"""" for evolution.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.7.82.22   

What do you mean by all that bombastic rigmarole?! I am stating a very simple truth, which is that African Americans are a mixed race because we have Caucasoid, Native American, and Negroid in us. People might wonder to themselves how can Tisha Campbell be black or Negroid when she doesn't look black by any stretch of the imagination. The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community. I have several people in my family who are the color of Tisha Campbell and that's because African Americans are NOT Negroids. We're multiracials.

I simply meant that sterilizing those with Down Syndrome would do nothing to """"improve the race"""" or lessen the incidence of the condition. I'm unsure of the eugenicists' actual position on the syndrome, but considering some of the minor conditions they used to classify people as """"unfit"""" (some well within the """"normal"""" variance of human genetics), it seemed likely that they would have considered Down sufferers as unfit, and therefore candidates for segregation or sterilization. It would have been unjustified and fruitless, that's my point.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

149345,5af8fa7f5f5417ef,""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision.

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts. Then when you suffer massive butthurt you'll quit and realise it was also fucking pointless being such a grandstanding bastard.""",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

It looks better than what was previously described, but it still is very light on source material (only one source for the article.) Additionally the article could use some fact-based expansion of the material to read more like an encyclopedic entry. To me it seems to be a series of poorly documented bullet statements at the beginning and also needs little corrections such as stating a person's full name before referring to them by title and surname only.

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand.

I have just been blocked by user FeloniousMonk for issues surrounding the entry on Christopher Michael Langan. This entry has been fraught for some months, but my contribution has been confined to the last week or so.

I acted several days ago on a longstanding request by the subject of the entry to remove what he considers a potentially libelous section of the entry. User Jimbo Wales judged the section to be blatant original research and deleted the section. This followed many months in which several editors, including FeloniousMonk, refused to see any problem with the section. Some editors were needless to say displeased with this correct decision by Mr Wales, and argued against it, although they did not try to re-place the deleted section.

I have provided extensive arguments on various other content issues to do with the entry. Progress was being made toward improving the article, but some users whom I consider clearly biased against the subject of the entry, had difficulty accepting these arguments. Other editors agreed with my arguments, which were extensively but politely put. Some editors changed their position on some issues, such as the issue of whether to include certain links, which user Arthur Rubin originally opposed the inclusion of (deleting them with little reason given), later acknowledging that inclusion of the links was legitimate.

FeloniousMonk is an editor involved with the entry, and he is blocking for reasons of a content dispute. This is in violation of policy. In addition, he has not provided any arguments why my edits are sanctionable. I do not believe there was a problem with my edits, the vast majority of which were confined to the talk page of the entry, and I would ask any administrator to examine my record. My userpage contains some links at the bottom to recent important edits in relation to this entry, including many by myself.

Some users implied that I was in fact a sock-puppet for the subject of the entry. I realised just before this block was placed that a checkuser request was conducted a couple of days ago that showed I was unrelated to Langan. I in fact live outside the United States, do not know the subject, am not a proponent of his ideas, and am not a proponent of intelligent design. I have stated this previously on several occasions. A link to the checkuser request is located at the bottom of my user page.

If you look at template:cite book you can see the parameters for a template that defines a cited book.  I always use this template (or others like template:cite journal or template:cite web) because they automatically put the different bits of information into the right format.  template:sfn gives a way to easily make a reference and footnote that link to the cited source, thus:

Displays as:

The trick here is that the """"cite book"""" template includes """"|ref=harv"""" which tells the template to make a footnote from the author's last name and the year of the book, e.g. """"Smith 2009"""", and link it to the book definition.  That may not always be possible, because the author's name and/or publication year may be unknown, in which case you can tell the template what name to use for the footnote, as in  |ref={{harvid|Norwegian Blue}}

You are a clever bloke who can bat this backwards and forwards as well as anyone, but I think that anyone genuinely objective would think that you were over-the-top.  The picture you paint of me is unfair.  E.g the Mail did say thetre was something reasonable about a Nazi slogan, but you conflate me saying so with my attitude to this Christian geezer, inferring that I called him a Nazi.  You follow me a bit too closely.  I concur with every single Wikipedia rule without question, but feel that they can be manipulated and used selectively by editors; and that some administrators sometimes go too far then won't back down, and a few seem to enjoy it.  If I could find a way technically, I bet I could also find five Wiki users and possibly administrators to support me over Christian.  Personally, as I have said before, I would welcome a mandatory test for all those wishing to edit, and I'd add ongoing peer-review from equals.  

If you watch me for years you will probably find reasons to block me, but its seems a bit draconian and a waste of your time.

Vandalism question
This page seems to get an unusually high incidence of vandalism.  Normally, a page has to be either a featured article or a very public and controversial topic to be vandalized this regularly.  Any hypotheses about why this page is so regularly attacked?   (talk) 
Pretty sure """"Pulley"""" is British slang for Handjob. I've heard it a few places across the web. I'm assuming that's it's consistently  vandalized.   
Theory of operation
I added a theory of operation section, and used two of the pulley system images from the original article. I have removed the simplest compound pulley image, because its practical implementation is not different from the diagram, which is the case for the other two - they are different from the diagrams. I also removed the """"historical images of pulleys"""" because it didn't seem to add much, without an explanation. Maybe it could go back in under a history section?  

how about the diameter of the wheel?   doesn't that have something to do with the force necessary to lift an object?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 
 Nope, nothing.  The forces on either side of the pulley are the same regardless of the radius of the wheel.  Okay, actually that's for a theoretical pulley.  A real pulley will suffer some slight amount of friction between the fibers of the rope as it goes around the pulley.  A larger diameter pulley will deform the rope less resulting in slightly less friction.  But that is a miniscule effect compared to the normal forces used on the pulley.   (talk) 

 Bicycle chain pulley? 

Is it correct or incorrect to call the non-driven wheels in a modern bicycle rear derailleur pulleys?  The chain is kept in place by its side-plates and small """"near-teeth"""" in the pulley, rather than by fitting in a groove.  This particular application also involves no mechanical advantagejust tension adjustment.  Are there other applications where chains and wheels function as cables and pulleys? 
In the context of the six simple machines, yes, a derailleur would be considered a pulley - specifically a """"class 1"""" pulley with a mechanical advantage of 1.  The fact that the """"groove"""" is on the chain rather than on the wheel is a minor variant.  The definition of something as a simple machine is based on how the force is transformed as the force does work.  Any situation where the force is being carried through tension and where the direction is changed would probably count as a pulley.   (talk) 
Sheldon Brown had these entries in his glossary: -  
Idler: """"An idler is a pulley or roller that does not produce any mechanical advantage, nor transmit power to a shaft. Idlers are used to lead a chain around a bend (as in short wheelbase recumbents), or to take up slack in a drive chain (as in a tandem chain tensioner, or the pulleys in a derailer.""""
Chain pulleys: """"Most rear derailers use two pulleys in a spring-loaded cage to regulate the tension of the chain as it runs over different sized sprockets. The upper pulley is called the """"jockey"""" pulley, the lower one is the """"tension"""" pulley.""""
Jockey pulley: """"The upper pulley on a rear derailer. This is the pulley that actually guides the chain from one sprocket to another. Shimano jockey pulleys are designed with a """"Centeron®"""" mechanism that allows a small amount of sidewards motion to compensate for imprecise index adjustment.""""

 Additional Information Needed 

I think information should be added to this article to recognize a """"sheave"""" as a type of pulley.  I'm probably not the right person to add this, but I do know that they are commonly used in oceanic applications suspended from an A-frame on a ship and also for oil drilling.   Tired_Angel

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

Your donation will fund Wikia, Inc., which is not a charity. Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc.

 As for question 5, I will just put this behind because I see recent comments by P123ct1 that may indicate a sincere awareness and change of heart helped by GregKaye's mediation.  If P123ct1 is sincere and time will tell, and if I see no digs, remarks, notes tracking me, nothing underhanded, I will even go further and go back to our initial cooperation as it was back in July.

 I admit that I cannot tolerate bias and injustice, and as I once stated: """"My attitude is a reflection of the way I am treated. Treat me with respect for my knowledge and well sourced contributions, and don't gang up on me when I have not even communicated with you, and I will treat you better."""" I also admit that I need to improve my style and attitude as they always mirror the style and attitude who address me, and I invite you to do the same, Bishonen. As for Tecnophant and Dougweller, I will also just leave that behind, as I saw Dougweller showing evenhandedness today.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8.

An interesting comment:  """"Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: """"effectively abolished slavery...""""

True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the """"involuntary servitude"""" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? 

Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? 

One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article.

It is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks, though there are some who disagree with that. If when you remove a personal attack you are reverted, then do not remove it again. Instead seek an outside party to investigate, preferably on some sort of public noticeboard. I really do not know the first thing about the Ireland dispute and from what little I have heard I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot poll.

No, there are not different standards for different editors. There is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system, and those who do not grasp the intricate details. While Wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. Knowing the correct """"form"""", noticeboard or procedure will take you far, knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther.

Thanks for your comment.  I don't get much feedback about my translations.  I think the problem you have identified may be something other than a translation problem.  I have simply done a literal translation of the German text.  The comparison is with classification type A.  An R class loco will have been engineered to be able to go around corners faster than its A class equivalent.  So, eg, an Re 6/6 (bogie type Bo-Bo-Bo) loco will have a higher maximum cornering speed than an Ae 6/6 (bogie type Co-Co - less flexible).  The difference is particularly important on the Gotthardbahn, which is a very busy line with sharp curves.  This point is not made very clearly in the de.wiki article, perhaps because German speakers are likely to be much more familiar than English speakers with the Gotthardbahn.  Also, the first table in both articles is not as clear as the second table.  I would be happy to alter the first table in the en.wiki article a bit if you think that's appropriate.  Also, the word """"higher"""" may be a less confusing word to use than """"increased"""", even though the two words have slightly different meanings, and the latter is a more correct translation.

Oh, I thought that this might have come into play:

Others' comments

It is not necessary to bring talk pages to publishing standards, so there is no need to correct typing errors, grammar, etc. It tends to irritate the users whose comments you are correcting.  

Never edit someone's words to change their meaning. Editing others' comments is not allowed. There are exceptions, however. Some are:
 If you have their permission
 Removing prohibited material such as libel and personal details
 Removing personal attacks and incivility. This is controversial, and many editors do not feel it is acceptable; please read WP:ATTACK#Removal of text and WP:CIVIL#Removing uncivil comments before removing anything.
 Unsigned comments: You are allowed to append  or one of its variants to the end of someone's comment if they have failed to sign it. The form is {{subst:unsigned|USER NAME OR IP}}, which results in —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) ..
 Interruptions: In some cases, it is OK to interrupt a long contribution, either by a short comment (as a reply to a minor point) or by a headline (if the contribution introduces a new topic). In that case, add """"Headline added to (reason) by ~~~~""""). In such cases, please add {{subst:interrupted|USER NAME OR IP}} before the interruption.
 When a long comment has formatting errors, rendering it difficult to read. In this case, restrict the edits to formatting changes only and preserve the content as much as possible.
 On your own user talk page, you may remove comments from others, although archiving is generally preferred. The text of another user's comment, however, may never be directly edited to misrepresent the person or change the meaning of the comment.
Must be tricky deciding 'when' to be 'diplomatic' or to cite rules when they are broken. I will pay more attention to see when it is appropriate.  | Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

As I stated previously, my speciality is Egypt, not Rome, but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era.  Basically, scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving, accommodating, or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity.  Rather, scholars of the period -consciously or not - tend to describe by analogy with Christianity.  An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as 'victorious''triumphant' or 'vindicated'. The words mean 'a true voice' and literally means that what one says will come about - but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin, having overcome Satan through faith in Christ. The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation. The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17, where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise, and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about. A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet, such that what he commanded to happen would happen, therefore according to the Christian model, this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

I would be interested in getting your views on the role of Tyrenius as a mediator on the Michael Ignatieff talk page. Does he have any status as a mediator?  By that, I mean, do the participants on the page accept him as a mediator or is he self appointed. (I'm mindful both these conditions could apply). How effective has he been in a mediation role?  What problems have arisen, if any?  

The reason I ask is that (as you will have seen) he made a preemptory removal of some text from the page. This is something that is generally frowned on in my experience. His response to my quoting the guideline on the subject was to remove that too. In the words of the guideline, this is """"unacceptable.""""

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

Ok, here's the God's honest truth:

It was however pretty rude. Did you really not notice?

Nope. I thought it was a generally polite critique

Btw, as it says on the FAC page, new nominations go at the top. 

I can't say I read that bit too closely

Don't you see anything wrong with bouncing yours up to upstage newer noms, with extra attention as the top post and extra time on FAC before your article """"rolls off""""? 

I didn't think about it thqat much

1) What was your purpose in moving the nomination to the top?  

So that it hot more attention and constructive critisism.

did you notice Worldtraveller moved your nomination back down with a rather tight-lipped edit summary?

No. I never ventured to read the history page

Johnleemk also warned you that he considered your """"playful jibe"""" a personal attack. 

I would like to point out that I was quick to correct him

C'mon, the place for """"playful jibes"""" like that is in interchange with friends who're used to your tone and will (I presume) enjoy it! It's just foolish to hurl them at strangers, and even more foolish to keep it up when they show they've taken umbrage.

 I followed the links to an article on """"consensus decision making"""".

I don't know if it would be appropriate to link back here (sort of a 360 degree thing), but it certainly is relevant. 

 Perhaps an article on """"Quaker meetings"""" might be worth considering? I'm thinking in terms of examining several types of Quaker meetings (clearness, weddings, threshing, as well as business) in light of Quaker philosophies or traditional practices. Put another way, I am growing increasingly sensitive to cataloging """"weird Quaker ways of doing things"""" in a de-contextualized sense. Perhaps we would be better off discussing how the Quakers' beliefs led to these different ways of meeting? 

 Some suggestiongs: 
Universal ministry (everyone a minister), 
immediate access (not mediated by Priest or ecclesiastical structure), 
privileging peacemaking (refusing to accept any sort of social darwinism in which the strongor aggressively vocalprevail), and 
testimony of integrity (challenging participants to put beliefs into actions, even if it leads to unconventional methods)

 It doesn't have to be an apologetic for Quaker practices, but it would help explain why these practices are held so closely by Quakers, even of dramatically different theologies.

 And thank you all, for putting up with my """"bull in a china shop"""" entrance. My entries could have been read as patronizing and as assuming that I was the only """"real"""" Quaker present.

Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]

While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. 

The openening sentences which say, """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year."""" should be changed to """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.""""   

Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. 

Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, """"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%."""" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. 

Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  

It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context.......

 Unwarranted remarks 
hello.  First of all, I'm very well aware of """"3RR"""", and secondly, you should be aware that I did NOT reach """"3RR"""" or violate anything.  Thirdly, it would be nice (for consistency's sake, but since I see favoritism and politics at work here) that you would give that same lecture to Malik.  Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh """"3RR"""".  Of course you didn't, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow """"ICGC"""" was somehow """"not notable"""".  Never mind that they've been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  Never mind that they've been around for decades.  And have internet sites for years.  You'll knee-jerkly take Malik's side on this, because after all, he's """"Malik Shabaz"""".  A bully on Wikipedia who is revert happy, and for some reason you favor.  I do NOT appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page.   I did not violate anything. NOTHING.  But Malik was arguably violating """"I don't like"""" and """"no own"""".  You'll deny that, because after all, he's Malik.  And for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  So now that Malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesn't bode well for me, does it) it's hard for me to do anything.  Yes, I'm angry.  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  I violated nothing.  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.  Yet you wink at it, or deny that, because, well, he's """"Malik"""".  Good day.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

 Plot 
I changed  this is a highly fictionalised account of Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta's actual trip to Las Vegas around the same time period.
This is contracticed many times through out the article. In one instance, under the Pre production sub heading it says:
Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says:
Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.
Although it is a far fetched story, it is not highly fictionalised and regardless, it can't say it is if there are statements throughout the rest of the article from direct sources that are saying it is real.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting """"immigrants"""". They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize """"Don't sweat the small stuff"""". Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

The problem is, while there are examples of androcentricity in language (although its effect on cognitive and social processes is debatable), the examples she cites are not, and she makes the rather fatal mistake of conflating grammatical gender with """"natural"""" gender and the diachronic with the synchronic analysis of language. She also seems to accept an extreme version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis completely uncritically, although the hypothesis is never even mentioned explicitly in the draft. It's pretty clear the author has not had any formal training in linguistics (or in the languages she has attempted to analyze), and appears not to have consulted the rather vast body of academic literature on androcentric language. Or perhaps she had, but decided ignore the inconvenient conclusions?

Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""
Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar.

146372,2b2abfa22ba63b2f,""":::Even during the 1891 census, castes like Vilakkithalavan and Veluthedan were counted separately. 90% of the Nairs counted in 1891 belonged to the Kshatriya divisions. The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them """"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas"""". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them """"Nagara Kshatriyas"""" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. 

However the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four """"Suryavanshi"""" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). 

Regarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don't think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no """"conversion of caste"""". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added """"Nair"""" or """"Pillai"""" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.

 Original Research/Other 

The article mentions some details about the combos, as well as character storylines.  Although these things do seem accurate, a lot of material seems to have been written by someone familiar with the game and doesn't cite the source.  Perhaps a simple sentence, like """"The arcade included the following descriptions"""" would be more precise.  Meltdown's name is probably able to be cited from a Nintendo Power.

Winning the game with Eyedol does have an ending storyline that clearly parodies Blanka from Street Fighter II.  Another note is that the SNES version had a different ending (saying something about Eyedol's bracelet) whereas the arcade version mentioned the club.

Some notable game play features: I think the sky stage is perhaps noteworthy, as it could lead to some very short games on the arcade (although the Tekken series was known to have even faster fights).  Also, in the arcade Eyedol had a notably easy infinite combo (when the opponent was at the edge of a stage), plus a much more difficult infinite combo (running back and forth), and the SNES version didn't have these things.

The comment above about tapping a low button might be referring to the easy repeatable combos in KI2, which would be another game.

KI1 and KI2 used the exact same motherboard (the model # / name / whatever was identical on both motherboards), and the software was different only by the chips installed in the motherboard and the hard drive.  (Surprising, perhaps, considering how different the games graphical feels look from each other.)  These games used the Ultra 64 hardware, which was the correct name for the hardware at the time of KI1's release.  Rare had said (in some unofficial strategy guide) that they had no concerns/reason-to-worry about KI Gold matching the performance of KI2, making some smart remark about those concerns only being needed when moving to a less powerful machine.  (KI Gold was initially also going to have more characters, but the memory limitations of the cartridge later proved to prevent this.)  Therefore, it's not out of line to think that the N64 is really significantly different than the Ultra 64, other than the lack of the hard drive.  Cruisin' USA is known to use some other motherboard, and reference the Ultra 64 just as an unrelated advertisement.

Bugs in the game could probably get their own section, including Orchid's attacking after turning into a frog, opponents shrinking with Thunder's combo, Riptor being unable to get a high hitting combo when the Ultra misses, and the fight being able to continue on after Orchid initiates her Ultra (if initiated after hitting the opponent into the air and then backflipping, and having the opponent hit her out of the Ultra).""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 New station names - """"Shanghai East"""", """"wuhan South"""", """"Wuhan West"""" - on tielu.org 

I wanted to see how the new train services after the opening of the Shanghai–Nanjing High-Speed Railway show up on www.tielu.org. (I am not endorsing that site, but it just happens to be the one Chinese train schedule site that I am familiar with). As I query """"上海"""" to """"南京"""", the full list of trains shows up, including dozens of the new expensive G trains. The trains that arrive to Shanghai Railway Station are listed as coming to 上海 as expected. But - quite surprisingly - those trains (the majority of the G's) that I believe are going to Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station are shown as arriving to some place called """"上海东"""" (""""Shanghai East"""") instead! So apparently this is how tielu.org chose to call the new Hongqiao Station... Moreover, Wuhan's two """"old"""" stations, the Wuchang Railway Station and the Hankou Railway Station got new monikers as well - 武汉南 (""""Wuhan South"""") and 武汉西 (""""Wuhan West"""") respectively! (See e.g. the schedule for D3010, Wuchang - Shanghai Hongqiao, or, under tielu.org's new dispensation, """"Wuhan West - Shanghai East"""". Now, I have used the tielu.org site long enough, and know that until quite recently Wuchang and Hankou always appeared there under their usual names, none of this """"Wuhan West"""" / """"Wuhan South"""" business.

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.

 """"terrorism"""" again 

An editor has twice attempted to add a """"terrorist"""" designation to the first sentence of the lead, as a primary way of identifying the Weathermen.  I have now twice moved the material down to the section of the lead where the designation as domestic terrorists is discussed.  This is a charged issue, arising during a campaign in which the Weathermen are at issue as a way of discrediting one of the candidates.  Wikipedia has been a battleground on the issue of Weathermen being """"terrorists"""", across a number of articles.  Although it is notable that the FBI called them terrorists in 2004, three decades after the fact, and their views are worth inclusion (in my opinion), the FBI is not definitive in assessing history.  This is not the US state department list of terrorists or any official US designation - it is a history section on the FBI website.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I have removed various references to songs that contain the progression for only very short, irrelevant sections of the songs. Why? So glad to answer.

 The """"source"""" given is Music Notes' sheet music, which is a website that produces and sells arrangements of songs and nowhere states to be a faithful record of the song as written.
 The Music Notes snippet shown is not enough to show that the song generally uses (or does not use) this four-chord convention.
 The Music Notes are basically just appended on with no proof whatsoever that they show that the song uses the four-chord progression. I could find the sheet music for any musical work you can think ofsay, Beethoven's Ninthand just tack on the Music Notes. Nobody's going to pay five bucks to read it (myself included) to verify.
 Those very same Music Notes do not even uphold the article's assertion in cases like Don't Stop Believing. See measure 7? That's a G#m chorda iii chord, which is not in the pop-punk progression. (G# in the bass, with G#, B and D# in the treble. Straight up G#m chord. Definitely a iii.)

Setwisohi sums up the issue quite succinctly with the comment """"we still have reliable 3rd party sources saying that UKIP are a Populist party against the opinion of one/some editor/s saying they are not."""" Let's be blunt about this: the 'opinions' of Wiki editors are not worth a fig. Editors are explicitly forbidden to base articles or edits on their opinions. It's the sources which count. While there are relaible third party sources all pointing one way and no sources offering the contrary view, there is no need for debate. And, contrary to what Twilde says, the word populism is not """"loaded, subjective and deeply ambiguous"""". Used by political scientists and commenators it has a very precise meaning. If some readers do not understand it, that is their problem and they need to find out more by reading the works of experts, but it is no reason to do away with it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

Let us examine what is considered """"Black"""" in the context of this very article. At the very top it states:

""""It is also used to categorize a number of diverse populations together based on historical and prehistorical ancestral relationships. Some definitions of the term include only people of relatively recent Sub Saharan African descent (see African diaspora). Among the members of this group, dark skin is most often accompanied by the expression of natural afro-hair texture (although a recent scientific study notes that human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations). Other definitions of the term """"black people"""" extend to other populations characterized by dark skin, including some indigenous to Oceania and Southeast Asia""""

This article even mentions Oceanians and Southeast Asians (such as the Great Andamanese, Native Fijians, the Ati,  and the Melanesians) even though these groups genetically have more in common with neighboring Asian populations and are very distant from other people who are considered Black Africans. Ethiopians are black Africans. Some of them have Middle-Eastern ancestry (Ethiopia is a short boat ride from Arabia), but that automatically does not make them an entirely mixed population; nor does it change the fact that their roots are mainly in Africa. Sicilians have some Middle-Eastern ancestry, but they are still considered European. Ancient Romans certainly referred to Ethiopians as black. They used the term """"Ethiopian"""" to describe all Black Africans they came across, regardless of their location outside of East Africa (read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_expeditions_to_Sub-Saharan_Africa)

I went to the Beta Israel page and found two very clear references: 

Ephraim Isaac (1974), The Falasha: Black Jews of Ethiopia. Dillard University Scholar Statesman Lecture Series.

Simon D. Messing (1982). The Story of the Falashas """"Black Jews of Ethiopia"""". Brooklyn. ISBN 0-9615946-9-1

Here's more from another article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel#Black_Hebrew_Israelite_immigration)

Rebhun, Uzi, Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns

""""The Israeli government has airlifted black Ethiopian Jews to Israel and given them citizenship in the same way it has been a haven to Jews oppressed throughout the Middle East and Africa""""

""""She told RT: “They don't want poor or black children and Depo-Provera gave them the opportunity to have control. If she [a patient] keeps taking an injection every three months, she is not going to have children – you know it is a 100 per cent secure from children I think.”

Hedva says the policy is working – the number of black babies in Israel is decreasing, but there are no official statistics to back up her claim. For community workers and Ethiopian women here, statistics are unnecessary – they feel their reality speaks for itself.

The Health Ministry admits it issues the drug, but says it was never its policy only to administer it to Ethiopian women and reduce the number of black babies in the country.""""

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.
These subpages are named to form the series links:

This is Qatarihistorian
First of all, user Mttll was conducting vandalism on a hidden agenda. He didn't like the fact the Sultanate of Rum is identified as a Persianate state, even though sources clearly indicated the Persianate nature/identity of the state due to two factors: 1) that the state was based on a Persianate court culture. 2) that the state's official language was Persian. 

Nevertheless, user Mttll decided to move the term """"Persianate"""" to the section of arts and architecture, in order to disguise historical facts. When I prompted him of this, he tried to FURTHER disguise his actions by renaming the arts and architecture section to > culture, but that still was invalid.

The irony is, even though he wanted to discuss this issue with me on the article's talk page, he didn't want to compromise, therefore he said something along the lines of """"I don't care what you think"""" and went ahead with his pathetic actions of distorting facts. 

I even showed in my edits that I had no problem with him wanting to call the Sultanate of Rum a """"Turkish"""" state, so long as he provided references for it. By the way, LONELYPLANET travel guides are not reliable references, I hope you people realize that.

Therefore in my recent edits, I wrote the Sultanate of Rum was a Persianate AND Seljuk Turkish state. It can be both at the time. They don't conflict each other by any means. Now the problem with user Mttll is his clear nationalistic agenda in the article, whereby he tries to promote only the Turkish aspect of the state while negating the sources to suggest the Persianate aspect.

In his user talk page, he is blatantly lying to the admin by telling him that I reached agreements with him. I certainly did not. And for the sake of wikipedia's reliability, I will ensure the information regarding Sultanate of Rum being a Persianate state will be restored because nothing warranted its move in that article, unless a hidden nationalistic agenda was intended.

The same goes for PmAnderson/Septrasomething, who hasn't really contributed to the debate for a while.  The useless point/counter-point we're participating in with Greg and Tony is driving away all the people who might otherwise come to a reasonable conclusion (or at least legitimize the debate) if we weren't monopolizing things.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

Notability of Julia Olteanu
A tag has been placed on Julia Olteanu requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Articles for deletion
Hi!  I noticed that you've been participating in the deletion discussions at WP:AFD.  Thanks; we can always use the help.  Since AfD isn't a vote but a discussion, your recent contributions haven't been as helpful as you might hope; in addition to a 'keep' or 'delete,' some information about why the article under discussion meets or doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards is needed.  You might find this essay to be an interesting source of advice about how to make your AfD contributions most helpful. - (talk · contribs) 
hmm i dont totally agree with you because why have a vote when the vote doesnt count. a vote should count in when a page is either deleted or the opposite.  
It isn't really a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.  Regardless of what you may think it should be, AfD is not a vote, and doesn't function as one; administrators reading the discussion to determine consensus just disregard any comments that don't include reasons that are based in Wikipedia policy.  You are welcome to continue participating in the way you are, but it is not a useful way to spend your time, since your contributions won't be used to determine whether an article should be deleted or not. - (talk · contribs)  —Preceding comment was added at

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

114686,655da6cb57de6b6b,"Vegan rebuttal 

Hello,

I have been following this vegan debate and I have to point out a failure in your revision.

You seem to be writing from a mainstream American or Western point.

Most of the world does not shop at supermarkets - they shop in open markets - and specifically, the majority of vegan would go out of their way to support small independent grocery stores not chains.

With regards to All cuisines, again, this is an important issue.

You get your point for knowing Asian food but it is important from a vegan point of view to show that vegan diet is not something alien from another planet as one contributor wanted to add but something local and traditional to all nations and races.

One does not need to list all nations ; Asian, Mediterranean, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Scottish, Italian, African, South American etc but yet they all have specific vegan dishes and ingredients which most metropolitan vegan sample.

A modern vegan will tend to eat a far wider range of foods than a regular omnivore and the topic out reflect it.

What is the specific benefit to writing supermarket or excluding all of the above apart to your ego?

Likewise there are many other sources to buy such products - such as the internet - so it is utterly unnecessary.

Let it be.

But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

 Translating on Xhosa Wikipedia 

Hi . Molo. )

My name is Anna. Jina langu ni Anna. ) I work for the Wikimedia Foundation in San Francisco. Nimefurahi kuonana na wewe. Nice to meet you. )

I'm writing to you because you were an active isiXhosa Wikipedian not too long ago and I hope you are able to volunteer there again. 

I've posted several notices on the Community Portal about en:VisualEditor. See: 53, 60, 61, and 62. Could you please translate my messages into isiXhosa?

Would you also please help translate the User interface and the User guide before VisualEditor is deployed next month. All you need to do is start an account at translatewiki.net. There's more information on the translating work at MediaWiki: Translation Central. 

Please try out VisualEditor before the rollout. To enable VisualEditor now, go to your """"Preferences"""", select """"Beta Features"""", and check the box to enable """"VisualEditor"""".  Tell us what you like and what you don't like, what works well and what could be improved. You can reply here, on my talk page, or you can email me.

Hi, welcome to wikipedia, but please read the editing guidelines before you dive in and make significant edits.  I had to revert your work because we don't create galleries in good quality wikipedia articles (wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a scrapbook) and because you need to read articles before editing them, particularly when you say something that is already said in the very next paragraph.

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are a few good links for newcomers:

 The five pillars of Wikipedia
 How to edit a page
 Help pages
 Tutorial
 How to write a great article
 Manual of Style

Here are some other hints and tips:

 I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.  (If you edit without a username, your IP address is used to identify you instead.)
 When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Where to ask a question, ask me on , or type  {{helpme}}  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian.

'Cause... actually, there's nothing rude about it. It's stating facts. The info is not in the body of the page nor does she want it to be, and she does all want it removed from the infobox. She does want them to not exist and her comments on the Theresa Donovan talk page explicitly state that.

71503,bf67d219f255586d,"Regarding workstations, servers and mainframes 

I believe that workstations and servers are classes of computers, not sizes.

For example, consider the IBM Power 595. It is a server, is it not? From the page, IBM seems to think so, and it certainly fits the definition of a server, with that being a computer that provides a service(s) to client(s). Now, consider the IBM Power 520. This too is a server, is it  not? IBM thinks so, and it fits the definition.

However, the Power 595 is not a desktop. It is nowhere near a desktop. It is a rackmount (IBM-speak: framemount) server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (201.4 cm x 77.5 cm x 180.6 cm); and weight: (1,552 kg). I will personally give anyone who can fit this on an average office desk from Ikea, a cookie.

Now, the Power 520 is not a rackmount server. It is nowhere near a rackmount server. It is a deskside server, as evidenced by its dimensions: (540 mm x 182-328 mm x 628 mm); and weight: (40.8 kg). I will personally give anyone who can convince a Fortune 500 company that the Power 520 is a top-of-the-line rackmount server, a cookie.

Two very different machines, both in hardware and form factor, but they are still both classed as a server. Clearly, as evidenced by this, servers can be in many form factors. A server can be a desktop, but it is not exclusively a desktop. How the article is currently written seems to suggest that it is. A server can also be a rackmount, a tower, a blade, a deskside and a pedestal, to name a few.

Workstations also come in more form factors than just desktop. Many servers are desktops (as in horizontal) and are small and light enough to be placed on a desk (the second, more historical definition of a desktop). However, they can also be in a deskside, tower, rackmountable or pedestal form factor, just to name a few.

This can be remedied by not using classes to determine size. Instead, use form factors such as blade, rackmount, deskside, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Jim Heller here.  I tried to contact you before a few times but to no avail.  Sometimes I've just wanted to say hi, others I had a question concerning the early online ex-premie days.  I recall how one of the last things you told me before you bid adieu to the ex scene was that exposing Rawat felt at odds with your Quaker and ACIM beliefs and I assume you still feel like that.  Anyway, I trust you're well.  That picture on your website is the essence of happiness!

I'm bothering you now though, Scott, for a particular reason.  One of the premies editing the Prem Rawat article is alleging that the Mishler radio interview is a fake and I wonder if you'd be so kind as to drop in to that talk page and explain what happened.  

Thanks, 

Jim

Regarding Consensus

""""But Wikipedia's consensus practice does not justify stubborn insistence on an eccentric position combined with refusal to consider other viewpoints in good faith. With respect to good faith, no amount of emphasized assertions that one is editing according to Wikipedia:Neutral point of view while engaging in biased editing will serve to paper over the nature of one's activities.""""

""""At times, a group of editors may be able to, through persistence, numbers, and organization, overwhelm well-meaning editors and generate widespread support among the editors of a given article for a version of the article that is inaccurate, libelous, or not neutral, e.g. giving undue weight to a specific point of view.

 Article contains too much incorrect information 

I'm going to rewrite large portions of this article some time soon because the authors who wrote them don't understand what ad hominem means.  If there are any objections to this, please voice them here.  There is a very common misconception going around, that ad hominem is simply an attack against the person you're arguing with, but that is not necessarily the case.  Likewise, an 'attack' doesn't have to be name-calling or anything like that.  It could simply be something like """"you are wrong because you don't have a PhD in the subject.""""

There is a very important distinction that some, but not all parts of the article make between to types of attacks.
Ad hominem attack:  """"Your argument is wrong because of [something about the person they are arguing with].""""
""""That piece of evidence may be true, but how could you possibly be right, you don't have any kind of degree or certification in this area.""""
""""There's no way he could be right about this area of quantum physics, the guy dances around naked in his house!""""

Non-ad hominem attack: """"You're such a(n) [disparaging remark].  You are wrong because of [insert reasoning unrelated to the person].""""
""""These statistics from this highly credible polling agency clearly show that you're wrong about the prevelance of it.  Why am I even arguing with this idiot?  I should really learn to stop arguing with someone who couldn't even get a GED.""""
""""That's it, you're too stupid to argue with, bye.""""
""""Here's a comprehensive study showing why you're wrong.  In the future I suggest that you take some courses in this before arguing about it.""""

See the distinction?  If there's any confusion, I can clarify further.

Please note that there is an exception of sorts, if the person you're arguing with IS the subject of the argument, then you can attack the characteristics of the person which are relevent to the argument.  Although I'm not sure if that's really an exception or just not considered ad hominem to begin with.  It depends if you define ad hominem as """"attacking the person as a basis for your argument"""" OR """"attacking the persno as a basis for your argument in place of attacking their argument.""""  The latter definition has the exception built-in, since you'd be attacking the person in addition to (not in place of) their argument.

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

Peace! Always! Forever!

 Missing system? 

This page from the Organization of American States has a table about midway through it. In the section Mexico is has several different hurricanes listed. Between Janet and Tara there is a gap that appears to indicate an unnamed hurricane. The table attributes 960 casualties to this mysterious unnamed tropical cyclone. It also indicates that it took place in October, 1960. The problem is, this mysterious system is not in the best track. The last named storm in the Atlantic was in September. In the Pacific, the only October systems were Hyacinth and perhaps the deleted Gwen. And yet a search through the hurricane archive for """"Storm Gwen"""", """"Hurricane Gwen"""", """"Storm Hyacinth"""", and """"Hurricane Hyacinth"""" reveals only a single hit from the wrong year.

With all due respect....

I read  your   reply  and  and the other ones..  
I just can barley  reply  to   all these  wiki  pages  etc...not even sure if Im doing it correctly etc..wiki  kinda  blows....grin  its  way too complicated.

I have a  word pad  doc  on my HD  that I wrote    explaining  my  Internet TV  rise on the net....with  each  step,  documented  and complete  with   a  fast link  to the actual  source  material  etc...Newspaper articles.   story  the Annenberg school of communications at USC,,  in calif,  did on me  in 2003...  a  chapter in a book  dedicated to me  etc  and my stations........etc.
  each  step  of mine  documented with a link  to the Source    NOT  just me saying it,,,,  there are also  links  to my  Old   websites   during that period.....from the  actual Internet website archive???  did  anyone  even READ    and check  these links?  just HOW  Official   does this  source materiel  have to be?  they are some  VERY  credible  sources...etc....go look.

its not just me  saying all this....its  the newspapers  of the towns...and the  annenberg communications school at USC  ....and  the fact that the  Who-is  data  for  DaytonaBeach-Live.com   pre dates   anyone else claiming to  have done  Internet TV etc... that I know  of............   isnt that  KIND-OF  Official ?  etc...   I actually made history  by starting that TV station........

I think the info should be  entered into the wiki  and LOCKED   until  someone  else  can   prove  an earlier date,   and  BUMP  my slot,  just Like  I do   with the guy from greece, in 2005....I was here   before him  etc...and I can Prove it.

wiki  just  will NOT  check....my sources  are  """"VERY"""" credible.......and in english...grin

its  a simple  VERIFIABLE fact,,,,,,,(by newspapers  and the annenberg etc)  go  check the  LINKS  I put in.....most of them are my old websites  but two of them  are  My  claims to fame...  along with the who-is data  link for  DaytonaBeach-Live.com  

chapter # 8,  in  this  book  """"Darknet""""   is  also   all about  ME.
http://www.amazon.com/Darknet-Hollywoods-Against-Digital-Generation/dp/0471683345/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1338078728&sr;=8-1 

is  THAT  worth anything?
grin

we need  someone   that can assemble   all this info into a  few paragraphs,  with  all the correct links,    to prove  everything,  (which I have provided etc)
   and then enter it  into the  HISTORY  section of that page.........

if the wiki does not  put the  history info  in,  then the wiki is  incomplete.  and worthless as a  history check tool.and will be  bypassed   by internet users,   that will   use a more credible  and accurate  source  themselves,,,,  instead of the wiki  etc...

(if the wiki is not correct,  or incomplete etc)

the who-is  data  says I started in 2000
annenberg says  I  was rockin HARD in Daytona   in 2003
daytona beach's  own  newspaper story  from 2002 
and  chapter # 8  in the book  Darknet  are both,   all about me  and  DaytonaBeach-Live   

I included the actual links    to the articles  themselves.....( I forgot the Darknet reference   etc)
HOW  much  more  """"OFFICIAL""""  and credible,,,  does the freakin wiki  require  etc?  the links  to  the  source material is all there.......and as credible  as it gets.

I  AM  TheRaven...and  I was doin (IT)  down in Daytona Beach,   in   2000  to  2008, and CONTINUE  to operate as well........its just a simple fact...
does wiki  deny this?  or  NOT want to   record  and report the  correct history of  Internet TV?

I see your concern, a better article is what I am concerned about too. I've dealt with numerous kinds of text, I know well about text structuring and an aspect drawing my attention (striking) is the linear style of the narrative and the aseptic (surgical?) tone, with one-sided arguments piled up one after the other as a CV (resumée) can be, failing to present the real extent of his actions, not presenting critical approaches to his work or positions, despite his being severely critized by many reputed authors and groups (quite a lenghty criminal record is alleged). Formal rigidity covers up the real content (wasn't that actually what the Pentagon Papers were about? Just wondering...)   

I share your concern with the cohesiveness, the paragraph I embedded refers to the Vietnam War context when he was in charge and is intended to clear up what his profile is both at the specific moment and in general as a person, and don't intend to delete his """"medals""""/merits from the article, but offer a critical and balanced approach in the argument (""""completely different subject?"""", well it is directly related to the matter), so the reader can get the whole picture. A domestic issue? Yes (and no), the course of events at home were eventually to prompt the USA pull-out, so both are interacting. I accept suggestions anyway for another collocation or section for the paragraph in question. Thank you for mending, Ellsberg may not be a high-ranking official and needs a fix, there may be a proper word I am not familiar to (mid-ranking official?, I'll look into it). Top-secret, of course they were. The quotes are telling, I cited what the Papers revealed so that the reader gets the picture. My claim of not editing is just a mirror of your claim. Like you, I have a clear position as to the kind of figure and person Kissinger is, but I do not intend to make an article based on my point of view, just to balance it and offer a more realistic picture of the person in question, reality is dirtier, so to say.

I have posted my comments indicating that I would be offline after them as a courtesy to others, who might wonder why I haven't replied to them quickly or might not be doing so at all.  Not everyone checks user and talk pages to see courtesy postings about online status, etc.  Sorry that you find my attempt to be courteous to other Wikipedians """"annoying"""".  In the past, you (and others) have not understand my comments (see the archives); as you (and others) seem to mistinterpret what I write and to read intentions in what I write that I do not have, I have suggested that you (and some of these others) not engage in these kinds of exchanges with me; I do not find them productive.
I am replying only out of courtesy and so that eventually this exchange can be archived by the automatic archiving bot.
There is no """"rule"""" or """"guideline"""" in Wikipedia that one must reply to every comment in one's user talk page or an article talk page.  Replying is up to one's own discretion and time constraints (""""schedule""""). There is no requirement that editors must spend their time editing Wikipedia; WP:POL states the opposite; that one should not be criticized for how one chooses to spend one's own time.  That is the prerogative of each of us.  How we express ourselves, as long as it is courteous, is also up to each of us.  If we want to take our time to criticize others, we need to keep in mind that we are doing so in public space and that our criticisms are being read by whoever logs on to that space.
From my own perspective, I find the comment posted above gratuitous and unnecessary.  Irrespective of that comment, I will continue to post what I consider a courtesy to others since that is how I intend it to be.  I do not intend to annoy anyone.  The guidelines for how to address other users are in Wikipedia:Etiquette, WP:NPA, and other places linked in WP:POL.  I try to follow these guidelines in what I post in Wikipedia. To assume otherwise is to violate WP:AGF.  I am posting this reply in good faith as well.   

To others who might be more interested than some in why I may not reply quickly or at all: I explain that in """"N.B."""", but not everyone consults a user's talk page when commenting in article talk pages, and so some may not see that explanation in """"N.B."""" above; therefore, I have mentioned that I would be offline in some of my recent comments in talk page article(s) that I have worked hard on in the past.  I will be back offline after this reply and will not see what anyone posts here until I return to check the functioning of the achiving bot (I don't know when that will be).  I have a massive amount of work to do offline over the next two weeks, which has been delayed in getting to me (thus I've been online occasionally in the past week from time to time), but I expect to be away from Wikipedia after this reply for indefinite and extended periods of time both during and after the next two weeks as well (on an extended """"wikibreak""""; please see the template notice above).

 I always prevent Pakistani editors from POV pushing, but if they find a valid source, then one must accept it. 1971 war is the only war where India was able to defeat Pakistan. And Indians and Pakistanis must understand the difference between Battle  and War.

Sometimes two neutral reliable sources maybe contradictory and at that time we need to add both statement stating their sources, even if they are opposite in claims.   Emperor  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I highly suggest, that when you read an article, you read it thoroughly. If you are unsure of the meaning of something, follow the link associated with it, and read the article about it. If a link is not provided, a good dictionary site such as this one should help.

In relevance to Nightwish's musical style, they are not Gothic. For reasons why, i suggest you read the articles Symphonic Metal and Gothic Metal.

In relevance to metal genre pages, and metal bands in genre.

This article suggests that using """"bitch"""" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say """"bitch"""" as in """"Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."""" Black people will NEVER say """"woman"""" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word """"bitch"""" as a synonym for """"woman"""". It's the same way how black people never call a song a """"song"""" they will always call it a """"track"""" and if you call it a song the black people will think you're a """"square"""" ad """"not hip."""" That's how they are and it should be in the article.

 I had a concern about a case that was recently not accepted by the Arbitration Committee. I dont know why, but they were not given enough time to hear the case, and the case never had a 4 vote accept or reject following the policy. This user is a user that has a long history of personally attacking people, and has been warned in excess of over 1 dozen times. He has humiliated other editors in front of hundreds of other people on over 150 different pages and has personally attacked over 200 users since he created an account. Recently, an RFA was filed against him, and the proof was in excess of 33 items long, but was quickly deleted without giving people time to vote. I need this user to be aprehended, and face the consequences of his actions. I would appreciate it if you would read about this case here[] which is his arbitration page that I resotred so you can view it. You will see how much action is really needed in this case.

 Anti-Love Song 

I moved your information from the talk page to the main article. It looks shorter now, but I kept everything. The main reason it is shorter is because phrases like """"from Raven-Symone's fourth album, Raven-Symone"""" just become """"from the album"""".

This is the right way to handle singles that never charted. They don't get an individual article, but there's nothing at all wrong  with putting the infobox and description in the album article.

We haven't been working well together, but I'd like to try and change that. I can see that you are an editor that wants to do things right. Unfortunately, part of doing things right is to not create articles that fail guidelines. The guidelines for article creation on singles are at WP:NSONGS, which I kept pointing at every time I redirected one of these articles or nominated it for deletion.

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader. When I tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident, here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again:

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page. I have repeatedly objected and nothing is done. It is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here.

He himself has been reported several times for doing bad things like insulting people, and posted directly fraudulent information both to me and apparently to administrators.  I was not given any possibility of replying to the block request discussion, because he also did not link this anywhere on my page and on his page I saw a template (posted to him by a user of a different time he has done this) stating that doing so is required.  Basically, the user who reported me shows clearly in """"bad faith"""". The fact that I am being forced to defend on myself on Wikipedia for 12+ hours is not a valid reason for a block.  No """"personal attacks"""" were made, no """"refusal"""" to do anything was done as no """"orders"""" were given that could be """"refused"""" due to the fact the """"orders"""" did not even happen, and being a victim of others who are repeatedly attacking me and even deleting my replies from discussion pages before archiving, and defending myself from these continuous attacks, is NOT a valid reason for a block.  As for the articles which caused people to attack and harass me, nothing regarding these articles was ever properly done.  No messages asking to discuss it, no polls done to find out which information is correct, no editing done after my edits for the purpose of further improving the article, nothing constructive or reasonable whatsoever, just reverting the entire edit without discussion or reasonableness, lying about the reason for reverting, harassment, and making fraudulent claims against me such as """"adding information without sources"""", regardless of the fact that 1) I did not ADD any information to the article and 2) it is okay to add information that does not have  a source, and most new articles consist mainly, and some entirely, of such information.  Someone wrote something about """"friendly advice,"""" but not a SINGLE related comment was at all """"friendly,"""" and no advice was given whatsoever except for one which was both unhelpful and contained more untrue statements.  Even this administrator is purposefully making blatantly fraudulent statements, claiming that I """"ignored guidelines in regards to my signature"""", regardless of the fact that the one who changed Wikipedia's code to no longer link automatically is not me, nor did they notify me, nor could anyone think of a reasonable reason to do this, regardless of the fact that it has been less then 24 hours since anyone requested that I learn programming code and then re-code my signature to compensate for this flaw, that's right less then 24 hours let alone a reasonable time of 4 months or so (assuming the user has logged in for several hours every day during that time), and regardless of the fact that even in that minuscule amount of time my signature had already been re-coded before he ever did this block.  This shows that the administrator himself is specifically in bad faith by citing an alleged """"problem"""" that no longer even exists.  There is also a log of the LITERAL AND DIRECT EXACT OPPOSITE of the claim of the person who reported me (again, WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME TO REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE MATTER), at the Help Desk page.  I advise that people looking at this do not read that conversation as evidence of replies and such, because several of my replies were deleted before the conversation was archived and therefore it is an invalid archive, BUT it does show the exact opposite of this claim in that I specifically complained about someone for doing that very thing because the conversation between MYSELF AND HIM should be done at only ONE place, and should also be done at one of the appropriate pages, rather then being harassive by using different places as this Administrator is claiming I have done when there is direct evidence that I've done the opposite.  So the main thing being that I am the victim of numerous people attacking me, they should not have attacked me but instead should have done any of the things I mentioned, or some other reasonable thing, rather then reverting edits and then attacking and harassing me.  I did not deserve any such harassment and attacks and do have the right to defend such things.  If I am treated fairly instead then there could be a discussion on the matter instead of repeated reverting without any discussion, then no such people would be """"reporting"""", but, since I did not do the things in the report other then correcting articles, and since the decent reply to correcting articles which someone else thinks are incorrect is not to attack them as was done to me, the block is wrong because things should be differently and because the people who were """"edit warring"""" on purpose were other people rather then myself.

 José Eduardo dos Santos unknown to residents of Luanda, no memory of him exists!!! 

I am posting this part here has it is systematically removed from the main article page. It seems that the communist collaborators and ignorance will prevail over what is the TRUTH and what is obvious.  

The Unknown President
The population of Angola don't know who Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos is. In this respect Angolan intellectuals, Angolan parliamentarians such as Dr Makuta Nkondo  http://angodenuncias.com/denuncias/?p=638  and International Human Rights Activist have denounced this issue. In this regard the Angolan Raper """"Brigadeiro 10 Pacotes"""" issued a video music stating that in Luanda and in Angola no one knows who Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and in the neighbourhoods where he supposedly grew up no body know him either    

The Angolan music artists known as """"Tribo Sul"""" issued a rap music track stating that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos is not Angolan, which is a open secret in Angola.    We therefore call for common sense and request that the misleading information portraying Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos as Born in Luanda etc... as total fabrication and of bad taste, and misleading.

 Public Image edit or addon? 

I've overlooked some other contemporary musicians that have a more 'sorted' article about the 'Public Image' article. The current one is a bit 'dumped' in a way, it doesn't sort out her musical background, ACTUAL public image, etc. So I made a previous edit before of sorting it out, but was reverted. So I was wondering, would this be alright to add or consider ANY parts of the edited version to be added to the current public image article?? Thank You!  (talk · contribs}

 """"Ants evolved..."""" as a statement of fact. 

I was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article:
""""Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants.""""
Also, perhaps this statement should begin with the words """"Many experts believe..."""" or """"Evidence suggests..."""" etc. etc. rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.6.149.18   
 This brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science.  I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven't been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I'm right, but I may not be.   ~talk 
The Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.   
Very true.   ~talk 

 ants 

where do ants mate.
how long do they live.
do they have sex.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.7.207.156   

heh, viable question.  This spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and I did some rewriting.  It should be double-checked for good measure.  The article answers these well enough.  Ant's live varied amounts of time depending on many things.  Some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years.   ~talk 

 Common ants varieties 

There is almost no mention of Little Black Ants or Red Ants in this article. I see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them.

 Infobox cast list/billing 

I've noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks, mostly moving Patrick Dempsey and/or Isaiah Washington higher in the list.  I'm guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and PD's """"McDreamy"""" is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that PD/Ellen Pompeo and IW/Sandra Oh are the two """"big"""" couples on the show, but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of IW and PD at the bottom of the list someone's idea of belittling their roles on the show.  I double-checked the order with the most recently aired episode, and based on that I switched T.R. and Justin Chambers, as well as JP, Jr. and Kate Walsh.  The credits read, """"with Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey""""that final billing with the preposition """"with"""" is actually a good thing, it reflects upon the actors' value to the show.

Please, if you are going to criticize Wikipedia, do it through 4chan and be Anonymous instead of being an idiot and looking like a fool where people can look back, how I did, on your user page and see your mass majority of work you've achieved, and seeing that insulting user page, that's just insulting to everyone to whom works very hard on the knowledge basis for this website. This is just like advertising a product it a totally different products store. I conclude with, if you're going to stop being hypocritical and respect this community then I advise you to please take down that note in your page. If not then you can just leave and spam hypocritical deficiencies on another website.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Considering also that the Province of Kosovo and Metohija is an integral part of the territory of Serbia - Constitution of the Republic of Serbia

To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.
If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article.

Take Swift Stern Action against this guy

Hi Sue,

Long time. How are you?

I visit wikipedia only occasionally these days.

I just came across this: 

I think you should give Crossmr a stern warning of NPA and CIVIL on his talk page and I think you should remove that despicable PA and uncivil comment(check out the heading/edit of the comment /edit summary /etc.) from royaa's talk page. Or let me know if I should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself. I would be happy to do that. Thanks.

It seems that Crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda. He keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself (and his instigations) about them. It seems that he is unable to move on, and let peace reign, and is hung up on old already-settled bloated issues, not to mention non-issues. He seems to want to live in the past.
And to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of CIVIL and NPA on other user's talk pages. Talk about missing the plank for the speck. Tsk tsk. LOL. He should pay attention to his own Block Log  and history!!!!! lol.

He also needs to learn properly about AGF and pipe down.

His ill-intended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative. But instead of me being provoked, he only serves to amuse me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. But it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I think coming from an admin will make him, a general user, understand better.

Thanks and regards. )

 

PS. If first time newbie issues like first time misinformed """"vandalism"""" are brought up, especially from their IPs, almost everyone on wiki would be """"old vandals"""" because almost no one is expected to know wiki rules when they start editing on a whim via google one fine day. HAHAHAHAHA. BITE, AGF etc. Also was looking to merge those accounts and attribution etc. but never really got around to doing it. Though I think I had already mentioned it on one of the accounts user pages and also the edit histories and everything else is so very obvious! I had MYSELF mentioned that those are my accounts in my comments! Not to mention the archive! lol. Seriously, AGF in underlined bold for some people. LOLOL.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Would anyone object to having 1931 in the box, but with a footnote saying that, as realm from which others gained independence, not applicable to UK internal governance?

128785,b0ba9b056761079c,"""I've heard it said that Charles Darwin did not want to publish his ideas because he felt it would hurt his wife, whom he loved.  She was not an evolutionist.

That could be part of the answer. At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!.
A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.

Imho the first sentence """"Contrary ..."""" should only appear later. One who does not know anything about Darwin reading this page should have a short introduction as first paragraph, not a negation of something assumed to """"be publicly known"""". (Yes, I am picky ;)

Framework is now in place for a good article, but a lot more work needs to be done. I'm going to get to this on and off over the next few weeks (hopefully), but anyonelse should feel free to wade in - however make sure your """"facts"""" come from works in the history of biology, not from popular works as these often make sweeping generalizations about Darwin.

150540,6e019e391650cfcc,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

I was stuck for a piece about the anatomy of the, and wanted to figure out something about what llamas are made of, and happened to see that piece you did up at the top of the page. Thanks to that, I started thinking about something completely different, that actually made the entire story a helluva lot better.

The fire-breathing llamas were just what I needed.

Thanks a lot for the tip (although I know you didn't mean it). If you get a user page, drop me a line. These editors are crazy over any little thing you do, so I should continue this outside of the site (this note alone is enough evidence for the Wikijury to have me drawn and quartered, as my rap sheet indicates).

This is actually a quite controversial case, though I admit that the label Belgian is a little misleading, """"Trappist Quadrupel"""" is not so bad. Stan Heironymous, in his very well researched book on Belgian Brewing """"Brew Like A Monk"""", writes about La Trappe, which was briefly a trappist brewery in the Netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a Dutch Brewing company. According to those that sold, the problem was simply maintaining an order of monks. They did produce a beer which they called a Quadrupel. Moreover, Quadrupel has become a label on some american beers obviously of Belgian inspiration (and using derivatives of trappist yeast.) While this arguably makes Quadrupel not a style, Quadrupel is not listed as a style per say, but one of the myriad """"specialized"""" belgian ales.

 I really find your argument unconvincing, since the style guidelines make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competitions with a beer that is not appropriately labeled as something else, which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all. Yes, the BJCP styles include some catch all categories that aren't rightly considered styles, but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn't not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer. Since the guidelines are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader, I think they're great. (Indeed, I would appriciate it if those that object would show me where the BJCP contradicts the opinions of other groups on these subjects.)""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Albanians Descendants of the Illyrians

1-the earliest attempt to link the modern Albanians to the ancient Illyrians was made in 1774 by the Swedish historian Hans Erich Thunman in his book Untersuchungen
ueber die Geschichte der Oestlichen Europaischen Voelker (Research on the History of
Eastern European Peoples). Using Roman and Byzantine historical sources as well as
linguistic and onomastic evidence, Thunman was able to conclude that the Albanians
were the autochthon descendants of the ancient Illyrian populations who were never
Romanized like the Daco-Thracian populations, forefathers of the Romanians.
2-Austrian linguist, Johannes Georges von Hahn further supported the theory of the Illyrian
origin of Albanians in his work Albanesische Studien (Albanian Studies) in 1854. In the
course of time many other historians, archeologists, and linguists have provided further
arguments supporting the theory that the Albanians and their language are modern day
descendants of the Illyrians.
3-Albanians live in the territories once inhabited historical sources pointing to the movement become settlers of these territories.There are no historical sources pointing to the movement of Albanians from elsewhere to become settlers of these territories
4-Components of Illyrian linguistic elements such as names of objects, tribes,
names of people etc known can be found in the Albanian language.
5-One of the latest attempts in this ongoing effort to establish a link between these
civilizations is a book entitled Ancient Illyria recently published in London.It is a study of unpublished documents and
includes the book Illyrian Letters, written by the renowned archeologist Sir Arthur Evans.
This work sheds light on the society and the culture of these predecessors of Albanians.
6-The relationships of Albanian with ancient Greek and Latin testify that
Albanian was formed and developed alongside these two languages along the
shores of the Adriatic and the Ionian Seas.In 1864 Dhimiter Kamarda published his linguistic study Saggio di grammatologia comparata della
lingua Albanese showing its antiquity as well as attempting to demonstrate its close relationship to Greek.
7-Even according to the writers of ancient Greece, Illyrians and Epirotes did not differ from each other in any way. they lived and were like the modern Albanians, without any
difference;Toskeri is the southern part of Albania. Its northern counterpart is known as Gegeri.
  they spoke the language which we speak today Ibid p. 11In antiquity,
Herodotus wrote that, Epirus is inhabited by non-Greek peoples who speak a barbarian languageIn antiquity, Greeks used this term to refer to foreigners. Indeed it was this non-Greek language which was later going to be one of the distinguishing elements setting the Albanians apart from other nationalities of the Balkan Peninsula.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I am a new user (about two months) and live a peripatetic life, migrating from Nepal to St Paul Island, Alaska with frequent stops in Othello, Washington, where I grew up ages ago (I'm 51). I have had several 'careers' but now work as quality control and health and safety person (seasonally) for a small fish processing plant on St Paul island to finance my travels.
 
My WP editing is mostly typos and usage stuff (see slaying slews on my user page), adding links to deadend pages, and I have started participating in some AfD debates, although not many. I have created one new article, the short and rather minorly important Corfu slide.
I've had one small run-in with another editor (see Re: my copyvio tag on User talk:Noroton)regarding my mistaken blanking of an article for copyvio. I apoligized to him although I'm not sure if the article had been cleared although the notice was removed.
 
The primary reason I requested adoption was that I am looking for some direction on copyvio matters. I hit the random page button alot and also work on deadend pages and I seem to be seeing tons of stuff that violates copyright, obvious cut and paste jobs about companies or persons, usually with a link to the copyvio right at the end of the article! 
Looking at WP:CV I seem to get conflicting directions. The first box advising proposing speedy deletion and leaving the article intact, the second box (titled 'Article?') saying to revert if possible, if not then blank the page, etc.
Then I see this, '...Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text that is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect their right to post it here under the GFDL. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the Web that was copied from Wikipedia. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future...,' in WP:C which would seem to allow most of the things I have tagged and/or deleted!

I have done different things at different times, deleted copyvio and left a stub if I think it notable, proposed speedy, blanked and listed (the 'Article?' option), and with one exception, my mistake which I apologized for, I haven't received any feedback + or -. I must admit that the laziness rather than the legality of it is what bothers me about this as in most cases the website and article creator are probably one and the same, but still...
Here is some examples.
 

New page, West Wisconsin Telcom is a copy from the 'about' page of, you guessed it, [Wisconsin Telcom]. The page was created in one edit by a user with no other edits and no user or talk page. 

Marriage Equality New York Inc, is copied from: here

Altoona community theatre which is copied from hereand here

What is the proper way of dealing with this?
 Propose speedy delete and leave page intact?
 No clean revert so blank and use copyvio|url=www.wwt.net/aboutus.php, and the rest of the stuff in the 'Article?' box?
 Leave it for someone else to deal with and mind my own business?

Wikipedia can be a little daunting to newcomers as there seems to be much jargon, abbreviations and references to seemingly conflicting WP pages and policies. I have no problem being bold but also don't want to be a jerk. It would be great to have someone with experience to check with on occasion.
OK, that's what I'm really wondering about right now. I have stopped doing anything about copyvio for now other than adding pages to my watch list until I get some direction on this.

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard. Those issues are not related. I think that even critics will agree that Hubbard led an extraordinary life. And neither 1) nor 2) are really related to his """"personality"""" either. I mean, was/is Mandela a bad husband? Did/does he have a temper? Who knows, you certainly won't find out in our article on him.

Plagiarism is not copyright infringement. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different transgressions. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material protected by copyright is used without consent. On the other hand, plagiarism is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship.

Content issues

There are emerging guidelines within the Indigenous peoples WikiProject that I have begun to apply across the board for BC First Nations.  The main one is that there are different types of articles, even when their content and location/people may seem to overlap (I'll sign each section/paragraph so comments on specific points can be made easily: 
""""Ethno & Culture"""" articles
Not as loose as it sounds, despite having to describe it like this: """"ethno/history/culture/peoples""""
which this article, as titled, would fit into.  These articles get Category:First Nations in British Columbia, with """"First Nation"""" here meant in an ethnic sense, not in a governmental-org one.  Ideally these will always be simply named, without """"Nation"""" appended, as with Secwepemc and Nuu-chah-nulth - or Stó:lō  (variable forms like Nuu-chah-nulth-aht can be redirects, although that term can include the Pacheedaht which normally wouldn't want to be called Nuu-chah-nulth). 
Government articles
bands/First Nations, tribal councils, treaty groups) which have government-related content, ranging from chiefs and councillors, affiliations, treaty issues, modern demographics, economic and social issues, and so on  These articles get Category:First Nations governments in British Columbia.  In the case of the Stó:lō the main government article is going to be (created in a few minutes...): Stó:lō Nation, and will list all its subgovernments; """"Indian Band"""" and """"First Nation"""", sometimes just """"Nation"""" are all interchangeable, although some bands seem to have a preference (at different times, given by variable content on various website sources); whatever is picked.  Non-Indian Act-based governments can be and should described under different titles, either in the ethno type or in the history type (see below) 
language articles
'nuff said, but can be titled either in native language (St'at'imcets) or in the form Shuswap language; Wiki guidelines, it should be stressed, prefer the latter (use English, which is the language of the encyclopedia...).  Some ethno and gov articles will have more than one language listed in their cats; some languages span more than one gov group, or in the case of the Sto:lo and Chehalis, two different ones.  Cats for this are specialized in the linguistics hierarchy (examples later), but they should generally all take the relevant nation-category if there is one Category:Secwepemc, Category:Stó:lō, Category:Syilx etc. 
Community/Reserve articles
Communities, reserves/IRs, towns that have significant native presence also; there is a difference, note, between the physical object of a reserve, and the band government that runs it; the descrption of the reserve is here, that of the government; even though this will not just overlap with the government articles but also the ethno/peoples ones; just interlink everything and it will sort of make sense; it's just a question of what was being searched for; the Scw'exmx and Spaxomin bands are all listed under Nicola Tribal Association, for instance; but the latter article is about the association, not about the communities; similarly, Shackan and Nooaitch are communities as well as reserves, but articles about them should focus on the community's particular history, not on overall Scw'exmx culture.  In the case of the Sto:lo, there is another issue of """"where to fit the Chehalis"""" as they are in the same cultural/language area, but they are not Sto:lo by organization or by their own appellation.  Or the Tsleil-wau-tuth who are culturally Skxwxu7mesh but are part of the Sto:lo Nation (or were, last time I looked); so there's some confusing bits here and there.
""""Mythology"""" articles
User:OldManRivers has pointed out the """"mythology"""" articles and the cats that go with them; awkward wording/titling but in the absence of anything more workable, that's all there is for now.
History/Biography articles
there is another sort-of category for specific history articles, e.g. Chilcotin War, Fraser Canyon War and various bio articles (Simon Gunanoot, Slumach, Klattasine etc.) where Category:First Nations history would be appropriate as well as either Category:First Nations leaders or Category:First Nations persons; there's also different cats like Category:Conflicts in Canada which may apply, or Category:Wars involving indigenous peopels in North America, which was specifically titled to allow inter-native wars as well as wars between native peoples and non-natives; and without the """"Native American"""" wording that that category at one time had",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

Civility

Normally I would let comments such as you posted in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/QStik Records (2nd nomination) pass without making an issue of them however judging from comments from other editors you seem to be making a habit of posting uncivil comments about other users.

The following RfC was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. I trust that Philip Gronowski will abide by the decision of the administrator who makes a decision concerning my dispute.  

Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as """"removal of spam"""". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is """"spam"""". I'd like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration, and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr. Gronowski.

56810,97d5035a880aa780,"Twisted Facts

1. Wal-Mart does not spend as much on insurance as other companies.

The fact. Yes Wal-Mart spends less per work for health.

The Twist. What they forget to say is that Wal-Mart does not buy insurance at 
all, it puts that money into a bank account, where it collects interest, it then contracts Blue Cross to admin the fund. 

The reality. Wal-Mart gives better insurance than most other retailers. 
Want to see for yourself go to your local walmart and get an assocate guide.

2. Wal-Mart does not supply as many with healthcare.

The fact. Yes on a percentage base Wal-Mart only 47% are covered.

The Twist. What critics don't tell you is that Wal-Mart offers Star Bridge health from day one, and that wal-mart has 1.6 million Workers with a larger turn over rate, so this leads to a lower percentage of works covered.

3. Wal-Mart has a high turn over rate.

The Fact. Wal-Mart does have a high turn over rate.

The Twist. Critics Site Wal-Mart as the reason, however most of people that leave walmart site customer related stress. And the area of walmart that has the highest turn over is also the largest pool of workers, cashiers. Plain and simple the customers run the cashiers out. And who can blame them think of all the people in the world you could not stand, and they deal with them all everyday.

4. Wal-Mart has more workers on state healthcare than any other company.

The Fact. Yes wal-mart does have more works on state healthcare.

The Twist. Critics argue that due to the number of workers on state healthcare is single handedly causing problems for many state healthcare,however what they forget to say is that Walmart pays 70 Billion dollars in federal taxes and nearly that again in state taxes and also generate billions of dollars in sales tax for each state with sales tax,which far out does the money spend buy the state on healthcare for wal-mart assocates. And many of the assocates that quilify for state aided healthcare also would quailify for welfare if they did not work for walmart. And would most likely be on both if they worked for a smaller ma and pa shop, that could not afford to supply any benefits. 

5. Wal-mart buys large quantities from china

The Fact Yes walmart buys a lot from china.

The Twist Critics argue that Walmart alone is the primary reason for US jobs being exported, however what they fail to say is that walmart is only 8% of the use Retail market, and 70% of walmarts income if from food sales and 90% of walmarts food supply comes from local and national suppliers, like con-agra. When broken down walmart sends a mear penny to china out of ever transaction. something much larger than walmart is helping china out. 

Now these are just 5 of the biggest twisted facts, there are many more out there, both good and bad for walmart, walmart does its share of fact twisting too. However I have seen almost no hard research here on any of the facts being relied on. I have alot of hard proof of lots of these twisted facts but I can not be the only one out looking for the twistes in the facts. And I also am not going to post any of the proofs until others start, because I want everyone here to start doing some research and finding some real reliable facts that we can bring this entry back to a good standing. But we must work together to do that, not against eachother. The Ace!",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

On your part you are not doing anything to prevent it. The anon has edited many more times than me and another bunch of users is also reverting the vandal anon. Why am I the only warned by you? Is this a personal fixation against me? Watch yourself Toddst1... I'm thinking about opening at Wikipedia:RFC/ADMIN an Appeal to the Arbitration Committee against you. Are you going to block me again for asking them for help? Or will you prevent the article to be vandalize? Probably your only interested in getting another banstar to your collection instead than making your job as admin? You are so conceited.

RE: Carter and Apartheid -  The article should mention that he was not plowing new ground.
More than one Jewish - Israeli """"historian"""" - real historians, really - preceded him
in the discovery that Israel acts just like South Africa did. I was surprised to see
the indignation expressed when Carter's book was first released. I thought then, and
still do, that it was feigned indignation for press consumption only. Without knowing
who expressed their hurt feelings - I bet I can guess as to who at least a half dozen
of the usual suspects are, sight unseen. I repeat, and the article should at least mention once, that equating - noticing - that Israel and its former staunch ally south Africa was not totally new with Carter, heck we ( my friends,family and I ) made the obvious observation years before the historians - decades before Carter ( at least publically) 159.105.80.141  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

As for my failure to provide diffs for mediation / arbitration purposes regarding offensive reverts without offending party allowing discussion, don't worry; I have all the relevant diffs. Where I come from, my understanding is that complainant first states grievance, responding party then replies and indicates whether h/she agrees or disagrees, if the latter, then complainant files evidence, (i.e. would be diffs in case of wiki). But it seems wiki process has other rules. And even if there are rules, the rules are worthless, as you've apparently stated above.

 Response to the lies in your RFC TAB 

HiTAB 

I posted this response to your RFC on Canaen.TAB I believe you removed it.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way.TAB 

The funniest thing for me is that you are busy digging a hole in your own canoe because your allegations are lies. You are entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant.TAB 
You are an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement. You have been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or these other individuals and yet you not only continue to go on making such allegations but you even use them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.TAB 
Don't worry, Karma will come and get you in its own time.TAB 
 TAB 
 ==User conduct RFC==TAB 

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you. It can be found  here. Cheers,  TAB 

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.TAB 

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity.TAB 
 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods.TAB 
I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine.TAB

-TAB:For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently. I am entirely responsible for kicking this whole thing off because I refused to let  get away with his ridiculous domination of the article and I put  in the same category for his anorexic stuff.TAB 

From my point of view, my objections are largely literary. The article became too bloated and required editing down. It is merely meant to be a definition of what vegan is. I don't see any point in actually engaging in those that oppose veganism. I don't even support vegan's trying to counter counter-vegan propaganda on the Wiki. It is best to keep it short and simple and give a few links so that folks that are interested can go find out more.TAB

Hi, thanks very much for the clarifications; I'm beginning to see where I've been going astray.  Let me check one more thing, if you would be so kind.  If we attach a load of impedance ZS (which may be frequency dependent) across the secondary, then the equation

should hold, provided that the load is a linear system; these variables are the (complex) Fourier transforms of their time-domain counterparts such as IS(t) and VS(t).  

I'm asking this only because I think this is where I'm going astray; personally, I think that we should avoid complex quantities/phasors, at least in the initial sections for lay-people.  Transformers seem hard enough to understand without introducing complex voltages and currents; I suspect most people would feel confused by them.  Leibniz says that complex numbers are """"amphibians caught halfway between Being and Non-Being""""; do you measure an imaginary current with an imaginary meter? ;)

Hello guys. I am not in a hurry per say, my concern is that, until very recently, there has been no hint of the text being edited, only talks about it being re-written some time int he future, in the mean time, AFD, Proarepa and the Beyloune and Barrueco family are mentioned the biggest encyclopedia on planet hearth in a huge scandal, without them having had had anything to do with it. Just imagine. All news reports agree on where the money came from, who carried it, for whom he was carrying it, who was charged with the crime and who the money was for. None of those persons have anything to do with the companies and persons on list A. Of course the following suggestion is tainted with my stance on this matter, but, perhaps, until the article is re-written, the text in bold could be suppressed, at least temporarily:

""""According to El Nuevo Herald and El Universal, Antonini Wilson owns a condo in Ocean Club, Key Biscayne, Florida; together with Wladimir Abad, he is registered as owner of a building located in Mashta Avenue, in Key Biscayne, valued at $US3.96 million.[22] Wladimir Abad is the secretary of American Food Grain (AFG),[23] a part of a Venezuelan holding called Proarepa, owned by Sarkis Arslanian Beyloune and Ricardo Fernández Barrueco.[22][24] Proarepa was in charge of the food distribution during Venezuela's oil strike of 2002, when Chávez signed contracts for food distribution. According to the Venezuelan Government Press Office, Proarepa is a private company that has """"joined this mission (Mission Mercal) to offer food and better price to the Venezuelan consumer"""".[22] According to El Nuevo Herald, Antonini Wilson's name is linked to other companies in southern Florida, such as Venuz Supply Inc., Intertel Telecom and Techmilk Inc.;[22][25][26] La Nación says that Antonini is among a group of businessmen who benefited economically during the administration of Hugo Chávez.[26] In May of 2007, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) confiscated a jet belonging to American Food Grain. The report, according to The Miami Herald, says Ricardo Fernández Barruecos had not respected federal norms to register the plane in the United States.[22][23][27]""""
The mention of Antonini owning the condo with Abad will stay, since there is a link there.

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Hello Nathaniel:   Sure thing about signing off the license, however I'm not so sure how exactly it is supposed to be indicated.  I added written releases upon other image work....   yet noticed that it still came up short in the opinion of others.

Will this work?:  """"This image is offered under [Cc-by-sa-2.5] by the creator of both the photograph, and its subject material.  TTLightningRod"""".   Should it say something else, or more?  You'll let me know.

As to my activities around here....    ya, I've been away a while for two good reasons;  One, I got too wrapped up in that frustrating wikipathology.  Second, I'm in the middle of a highly involved shop renewal here.  Lots to be done before winter, and of the utmost importance to me.

The hardest-working, most experienced, most involved critic of this article has misgivings about mediation. Let's start now.
Is the CMT fringe?
If a consensus is reached to the effect this is a fringe theory, the article will need to make that clear in a way that is neutral. Once. Not over and over again in every nook and cranny. Sly, underhanded discredits like the top link in """"See also"""" being to Bible conspiracy theory make you (whoever put it there) appear to be sleazy and contemptible. It gives the impression that you play dirty, that the quality of your argument against the theory is so weak you need to apply Fox News persuasion techniques. I'm sure none of that is the case. But that's the impression it gives. 

And the word fringe need not be used. The word in general parlance carries a derogatory implication (marginalized and nutty), whereas the way we use it, fringe theory is """"not mainstream"""". Something like """"the theory is not widely accepted by mainstream theologians and historians"""" conveys it's place in the field without stooping to derision.

Personally, judging only on the quotes provided by Eugene in the FAQ, which are opponents speaking, but includes one proponent (I think - did I delete him?) who concedes the view is considered eccentric, and in the absence of any counter evidence, I have no choice but to conclude it is a fringe theory. Can someone please explain to me why it is not?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

OK, now you're pissing me off. Stop accusing me of things that aren't real. What, in the his noddlinesses name are you talking about. I repeat, in vulgar and block worthy language, because your irrationality is making you impossible I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. I've said it three times, repeated it in the post you are refering to, and still you went on to make accusations about """"  a desire to focus on his point of view and not the consensus"""", when I have jsut said, I reverted you VANDALISM becuase you vandalised the defintion and not because of the reference to affirmative action. If you continue to lie about me I will stop acting friendly towards your edits, you irrational individual who I am struggling not to label negatively. There is no point about the affirmative action reference, as I said in the previous post. The fact I would contradict your lies (that affirmative action isn't always discrimination, when it is) is unrelated to that statement and your vandalism. If you feel a bit concerned about imaginary things, perhaps you should see a fucking psychiatrist, because feeling concerned about things that don't exist is extreme paranoia. Accuse me of bad faith again without a shred of evidence and i will strive to irritate you for every second until they block me. I cannot stand lieing and complete apathy towards actual responding to what I write as opposed to what you imagine I write. I advice you do not respond to this with anything but an apology, I can't see it being pretty. And now some quotes from the post you responded to, so that those smarter than you can laugh at your irrational response, """"I have no interest in your line on Affirmative action"""", """"the arrogance which drives you to completely brush off the rest of the edit and come here and accuse me of POV, when I was reverting to a consesnsus over an unsourced redefinition"""", """"I don't give a toss about the link between affirmatvie action and disscrimination"""" and """"stop accusing me of things that pop into your head"""".

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

Talk to Action ^ | Sun Jun 25, 2006 | By Bruce Wilson Hate speech is typically the first line of attack employed by bullies, but bullies become emboldened when eliminationalist rhetoric is tolerated, and that societal acceptance can lead to far worse things. I've previously covered hate speech - see Enough Hate Spech To Stun An Ox, and Hatecrime.org has an extensive collection of hate speech targeting homosexuals. Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...

 Mr. Rogers's Ghost 

Ghost of Mr.Rogers

I (Brittany. M) once went to my best friends house. Her name is  Jade. C. It was all fun and games for us until we kept hearing the door open and close, even the dog jumped up to see if any one was there, Jade was bringing in a dog (from outside) and saw a person shaped figure. When she came inside to tell me and her aunt that she saw someone we told her that is was probably her mom. When her mom came inside she claimed it was not her. Later her aunt was talking to Jade's great grandmother about sound horns. While that was being talked about Jades brother was talking about how people in their family was 12 years apart. Someone called at 12:12 at night (12 years apart) he said he was Fred Rogers saying he found our missing cat (on a cell phone that was abandonded, meaning no one uses) then we said we were not missing a cat then he said he was missing a brown fluffy cat. At first we thought it was someone drunk or a prank caller, but then we felt it was posessed, and we got so scared we couldn't even talk to hiim it felt like he was standing right outside our window. He asked """"If you saw Lady Elaine what would you say to her?"""" ,and """"Do you know where I could find any good horns for my train?""""(Jade's aunt and grandmother were talking about) It was too much of a couinidence to be a prank. It was no one in the house either because we were all in the kitchen. At one point we all fell on to the floor. It was soooo scary! and at the end of his show he goes """"good bye"""" and thats what he said on the phone. And every time everyone tried to listen to the call all at once the phone kept breaking up!""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car.

If it's real, he's not here to build an encylopedia, he's here to experiment with the patience of its community in a way that essentially ignores its rules while purporting to test them.  If it's not, it's a post-hoc rationalization (or blatant lie) that attempts to justify how his contributions have been disruptive.  Playing coy, refusing to actually share it or disclose the details of the report, the 'experiment', the methodology, the contents of 'phase II', his co-experimentors, etc. further renders it an invalid effort to criticize wikipedia, making it rather useless to talk about if it can't be used to improve the project.  But that's my opinion and a long discussion.  
I must apologize for not providing diffs here after your explicit request, but I really think the best thing to do is to review whole talk page sections - I don't see the advantage to posting multiple diffs when a whole section does the same thing in one fell swoop.  Content-wise, I think these two sections are the best to illustrate a critical feature - ME and CFS are considered the same diagnosis by the majority of the medical community, and there's minimal support for separating the two.  Talk:Chronic fatigue syndrome#ME or CFS contains references that explicitly state the two are the same.  Talk:Chronic fatigue syndrome#ME as a separate condition from CFS contains, from what I can gather, the best and most supportive sources to justify the two conditions being separate.  You can see my analysis and conclusions - I don't think it's sufficiently clear that the majority consider them separate.  From this point onwards, I would think a reasonable editor would conclude that the consensus is the conditions are separate, and edit accordingly (unless new evidence/sources came to light to revisit the issue).  In addition, the journal used was reviewed on RSN here and found wanting.  The keep-or-split discussion has been revisited many times - here, here and again here.  The same discussion, several times in one year, without any substantial new, medically reliable sources that clearly demonstrate there is sufficient support in the medical community for a separate diagnosis, has worn down the patience of many contributors; that it's been done with a fairly continuous level of dismissiveness of others' opinions, with countless insinuations that other contributors are either stupid, or haven't done their research, hasn't helped either, and then to find out it may all be part of some experiment that has nothing to do with actually writing an encyclopedia...

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Oh, Razorflame, don't you know how mathematics works? I believe the Aussies scored more runs. Let's break it down. The Aussies scored 527 runs in innings number 1 and 172 runs thereafter, totalling 699 runs. England started with 368 and in the 2nd innings received 37, equalling 405. Because 699 is bigger than 368, I find it in my best interests to have Australia as the victors. The difference is 294 runs. If you cannot do a simple addition, then I have no hope for your future.

 Background 
21st Century Democrats started out relatively small but has quietly grown in size and significance in the last few election cycles.  In 2004 election cycle, according to the Political Money Line, it was the 13th largest Political Action Committee (PAC) in the United States raising nearly $7 Million.  Among progressive ideological PACs, it ranked fourth behind America Coming Together, EMILY's List, and MoveOn.org.  The group's long time Executive Director Kelly Young left the organization in 2007. Former Executive Vice President Mark Lotwis took over as Executive Director in July 2007.

Unlike traditional PACs, 21st Century Democrats focuses on recruiting, training, and hiring field organizers to organize grassroots campaigns on behalf of candidates for local offices, statewide office, and even targeted presidential swing states.  The strategy enables the group to get a value added return on its investments, and has proven to be successful. 21st Century Democrats wins the majority of its races, even though they focus on tougher, competitive races up and down the ballot.  The group has strong ties to veterans of Paul Wellstone's campaigns, as well as Democracy for America, which grew out of Howard Dean's failed presidential campaign. {{| url = http://democracyforamerica.com/about}} ,

[My Reply]
This discussion was started on your talk page, please reply on your talk page and not elsewhere, this is common decency as others might be following the debate there and not where ever - thus I will be copying your reply to me and this reply to your own talk page.
Now to the questions you raise;
I have no need to complain to who ever placed the 'award' on your page as I'm not concerned with their action but your own, if the 'award' had not been present I would still have raised your edit style on you talk page, doing so is a way of informally pointing out to you (and others) that you might need to look at your action, rather than making any complaint official.
Now for the reason (in my opinion) you cause the decent you do: It's because of your style, not why you edit (or indeed what you edit), you think you are right and everyone else is wrong, even when the consensus or the facts shows otherwise - you might not like the """"cozy consensus"""", as you put it, but in a democracy that is how it works, if you don't like that simple fact of life Wikipedia is probably not for you. Buy yourself some web space, learn some HTML/PHP, then you can publish """"The facts according to Lucy-marie"""" to your harts content... ( )

( )

Does it really matter where a debate takes place? Also everybody has a right to hold a valid opinion here and each person does. I also loath your comments about """"the facts according to Lucy-marie"""" bit as I could interprit that as you thinking you are allways right and I am allways wrong in your opionion. I shall take it that as you are an """"older"""" editor you and your """"life experience"""" as some may put it would entitle you to that opinion, I however disagree. I Think we should all move on and I hope never to have the displeasure of running in to you again. I shall stay well away from your beloved train articles and shall edit other parts of wikipedia and retain my opinions to myself, hated meeting you. 

""""Does it really matter where a debate takes place?"""" Of course it does, if for no other reason that it keeps all the comments in one place, it also means that people who might be monitoring what is being said (for what ever reason) knows that the discussion is continuing - if it goes quite on a talk page has the discussion finished or has it scooted off elsewhere...

Speedy deletion of This Is Fake DIY
 A tag has been placed on This Is Fake DIY, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Neither word means """"side"""". However, both of these words are constructed from the root consonants ע (/ʕ/,), ב (/v/) and ר (/r/). This means that they may be etymologically related to words such as /ever/ (""""side""""), /ma'avar/ (""""passage""""), /avar/ (""""to pass"""", v.i. or """"to go over""""), /he'evir/ (""""to pass"""", v.t.) and others. As far as I remember, it is traditionally said that the Israelites' name """"Ivrim"""" was given to them because they entered the promised land of Israel by crossing, e.i. passing over the Jordan River.   

Thanks for your explanation ) it is a shame that I can't remember where I've heard it ( I'll put it in wiktionary )   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Comment on point of disagreement. While worldwide coverage (e.g., WP:BIAS) is not a GA requirement per se, broad coverage is, and that means the article """"addresses the main aspects of the topic"""". Exactly what this implies involves some subjective interpretation and judgment, which is one reason that GA reviews are conducted by human beings rather than bots. In some cases, it may be reasonable to argue that an article about a topic of global interest (in this case in most common law countries) does not address the main aspects if it only concentrates on the North American case. I suggest that the reviewer here applies his judgment. If the outcome is disputed, renomination or community GAR are available to obtain input from other editors.

Codex, p. 60
I will give the specific quote from the original text, which appears to be slightly changed []:

Τον ευλογημένον Ζαχαρίαν τον διεδέχθη ο Άγιος Γεννάδιος. Ύτος ήτο Σμυρναίος και αυτός αρχιδιάκονος του Ιωαννίνων, νέος τη ηλικία δεν είχεν ευχαρίστησιν να ακούη χριστιανούς να ομιλούν την αλβανική γλώσσαν. Φιλοδίκαιος όλως πολλά. Αρχιεράτευσε χρόνους είκοσι πέντε. Έπειτα μην υποφέρων την αλβανικήν γλώσσα εις τα χωρία της επαρχίας του ευχαρίστως έκαμε την παραίτησιν και αφήσας...

The text added in the article translates this entry as: In an ecclesiastical entry .... noted that some of the Christian Greek clergy had linguistic difficulties in administrating to their congregation, as Christian villagers living within the region of Delvinë were Albanian speaking.

It's hardly enough from the original text to conclude that the villagers were in general monolinguals, indeed it claims that Albanian speech was present and in significant numbers (it doesn't also conclude that all villages were Albanian speaking). Moreover, the fact that this produced linguistic difficulties in eclessiastical administration is something that only indirectly can be concluded, since the Codex mentions that """"a specific bishop, who came from Smyrna, found it not pleasant to hear his flock speaking Albanian, beacause of the Albanian speaking villages in  his periphery, and resigned after 25 years of local service.""""

Well I just finished a good bit of editing.  I haven't had a chance to go through and do all the tagging and referencing yet since work calls but I am extremely confident in the scientific factual basis of everything stated in here.  The referencing can pretty much be all made to the book """"Particle Imaging Velocimetry A practical guide"""" by Raffel, Willert, Wereley and Kompenhans if someone can add it.  Also, not sure how to exactly do that as it all can be found in numerous scientific journals, databases, etc. but is so conveniently placed all in that one book.

The only thing I am unsure about as I have no experience with is Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.  To put it simply, I would like to keep technique defects in the summaries but I don't know what this one's is.  To put is bluntly, the description as it is now is too good to be true.  I know it has defects and problems, I don't know what they are.  The fact is the technique was developed in 97ish and is not in widespread use.  If the description were accurate, everyone would use it.  I have met or heard of not one person using it, which means there is some big flaw in the technique that if someone can find, be my guest to add it.

Everything else, please post on discussion page before editing critical information as I am positive what I have said can be completely defended but am open to solid arguments.  I won't be pigheaded about it.

On January 8, 2008, Garrett reported that James Carville and Paul Begala were preparing to join the Clinton campaign, in a major shake-up of the campaign staff.http://www.newshounds.us/2008/01/08/major_garrett_from_fox_says_he_stands_by_his_source_that_begala_and_carville_are_joining_hillarys_team.php Despite strenuous objections from Carvillehttp://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/james-carville/ and Begalahttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-begala/fox-news-we-report-e_b_80698.html, Garrett stood by his story, which later proved to be untrue.http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/01/09/fox-news-wrong-about-carville-and-begala-joining-hillary/

Hello, Tgeorgescu... It was correct what you added, sourced, and valid what you put in, according to context, and according to WP due and undue and sources.  Your edit and addition were valid and correct, and arguably warranted, and I would never revert what you put it, because it happens to be referenced and sourced and what's stated by majority scholarship on this issue.   So it was a valid modification and elaboration etc.  To what I put in, that was also sourced.  As WP policy recommends, """"modify instead of wholesale deletion"""", to improve not remove.   And again, the point of Wilson and Cahill was in the context of the very section and paragraphs themselves, of rationalizing or explaining why Egypt herself never chronicalized things like the  10 plagues or the Hebrew exodus out of Egyptian slavery etc, or the destruction of Egyptian charioteers and soldiers or of that then reigning king of Egypt.   Of course majority historians discount it ever actually happening, but it's also known and admitted (as a general point) that ancient pagan nations or kingdoms in general would not always be so honest or straightforward or complete in their recording of everything.   Embellishing some facts and details, while minimizing or even totally hiding others.   And that was really the point.   Anyway, thanks for your work on it too.

Here are my thoughts in detail....  I agree with Kamosuke that China is similar to the Roman Empire, with respect to culture, politics, literature, arts, and religion, as well as its influence towards its surrounding nations.  More specifically, Luoyang (洛陽) and Chang'an (長安) are similar to Ancient Rome.  However, you cannot eliminate the mention of Korea.  From the dawn of historically recorded Japan, until the fall of Baekje, Korean influence was greater than Chinese influence.  Then there follows a period in Japan where Korean immigrant families remain important while Japan looks to China for influence; but eventually these families assimilate and dissolve into Japan.  A period of greater Chinese influence continues for at least 9 centuries.  However after Japan is discovered by Europe, Japan chooses a policy of sakoku for 200 years, where all foreign trade is conducted through Nagasaki.  Western influence is maintined through Rangaku studies and direct contact with Westerners at Nagasaki.  Meiji Restoration opens the door further to Western influence.

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

Instead of trying to reinvent Wikipedia, I would encourage you to try changing Wikipedia one small step at a time. It isn't easy, but the results can be very significant. I've had 101 policy and project ideas shot down, but I've also had a small handful that have been successful, and hopefully those small successes have made Wikipedia a better place.

Far from trolling, it's a sign that at least one candidate is guilty and didn't want to delete the comment from just their candidates article so they deleted it in all candidates.

The newspaper article that I read was about the Edwards campaign.  If I write about that, it would be potentially biased because all of them are doing it, not just Edwards.  So I thought just a general warning and comment on several article's talk page would be better.  It seems that this guy that deleted the comment is offended by the truth. 

They all have biased writing.  I don't have time to correct all of the articles but I don't want to pick on just one candidate.  Candidates of both parties have biased articles.

Hi user Biatch, got your message. Victorian Rules or Aussie Rules or whatever it wants to call itself is not really seen as a native Australian game in New South Wales and does not exist to a huge extent outside the top-down. I do not disparage AFL because it is a part of Australian culture, I disparage because it is not part of my Australian culture up north and that whole reference is dodgy.

30128,4fff8b434eb6241f,""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

60969,a33daee6243ef055,"""==bcm versus km³==
Dear Gene Nygaard,
You said that generally everyone understands km³. I am not sure about this statement and find this use quite unusual and misleading. Could you please give any example in gas industry where km³ is used (maybe just some newspaper article)? Also, if youd could find any article in wikipeedia about gas fileds or pipelines, which use km³, I would like to get a reference.  

Google """"natural gas"""" """"km3""""  823 hits

Note that Google, as far as I know, won't search for the ³ character, but this gets those that use either html superscripts, or just """"km3"""" and the like.

There are other ways to find more of them.  You will of course find many using bcm as well.  But as I pointed out, that may be jargon used within the industry, but it is not known outside the industry (there might possibly be other little pockets of its usage in other contexts, even less known). 

another search, on AltaVista:
km³ """"natural gas"""" 3130 hits. 

AltaVista appears to treat ³ and 3 as synonymous, unlike Google. You can limit them to .gov sites, or to .edu sites, too, to see that this isn't """"newspaper usage"""" but in fact more likely to take place in more serious and professional contexts.  

BTW, if you were arguing about """"tcf"""" you'd maybe have a better case.  That is common enough in the industry, more so than """"bcm"""", that it is better known outside the industry, too.  

I am able to use different search engages. However, could you please give any example of use km³  as an unit of capacity of gas pipeline? Concerning tcf (trillion cubic feet) - it's used more in the US gas industry, while bcm is used mainly in Europe. Don't see problem with this. If you look the external links of this artcile, you will find both: tcf and bcm, depending of the source.

 In the petroleum industry the unit systems used are Oilfield and Metric like what was mentoned above, all depending on where you are and who you are working with. However I have never come across km³ being used to describe gas field sizes or gas production and if someone was to describe a field or gas production in such a way to someone in the industry it would have no revelace to them, it is not a standard of unit. It would have to be Bcm, Mcm, E3M3, Bcf, Tcf, MMscf, Mscf etc.   

Surely, we writing for a general audience not only for people in certain industries.  km³ is standard SI if some people in some industry want to use something else, then that's their problem.  P.S. Hello Gene. ɪmp 

 Very true Jimp we are writing for a general audience. And when i searched some news articles by the likes of Forbes, CNN Money etc on Google news in the past month for the phrase km3 in relation to gas/gasfield/ gas field/ """"natural gas"""" it returns one result from Petroleum World. However the units tcf, bcf, bcm return   at least 102, 147,  51 hits when used with the above phrases. And these are from Forbes, Reuters, CNN Money, Globe and mail which i think you would agree are also writing for the General Audience. The numbers are in their hundreds of thousands when you do just a general web search for tcf, bcf and bcm compared to the 823 km3 turns up. So its not really just """"some people in some industry"""" using these terms.  Cheers  
Sure it is.  But that's beside the point; we at Wikipedia choose to use standard unit symbols, not all the various off-the-cuff possibilities, and km³ is the standard symbol for 1,000,000,000 m³.  It isn't surprising at all that financial magazines are too innumerate when it comes to units of measure to even understand what they are, so sure they get passed on unchanged.  So what?

I agree with your ideas about comprehensible articles on physics. I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.

I've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The """"simplified"""" article looks like a better place to start.

My experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments. If you live in a high-rise apartment building you might not realize you could just trail the antenna for a crystal radio out the window.

15666,29603f6765dece1e,"“Mark the cousin [a·ne·psi·os′] of Barnabas.” (Ac 23:16; Col 4:10) In Luke 21:16, the Greek words syg·ge·non′ (relatives, such as cousins) and a·del·phon′ (brothers) both occur, showing that the terms are not used loosely or indiscriminately in the Greek Scriptures.  

Matthew 1:25; notice the word until, indicates Mary did not remain a virgin her whole life. 

Some haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth. Thought the gospels several times point fact. However scholars have noted two things about the theories, that Mary borne no other children: One there is a motivate behind such theories, to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later; the church teaching that Mary remained a virigin throught her life. Two, the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example, one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers, sons of Joseph by a earlier marriage. This notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny Jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of David, another theory is, that were actually cousins of Jesus although the Greek scriptures use distinct words for brother, cousin, and relative. Thus scholar Frank E. Gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of Mary and Joseph they were brothers of Jesus on his mother’s side.

Matt. 13:53-56, Jerusalem Bible: “When Jesus had finished these parables he left the district; and, coming to his home town, he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said, ‘Where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? This is the carpenter’s son, surely? Is not his mother the woman called Mary, and his brothers [Greek, a•del•phoi´] James and Joseph and Simon and Jude? His sisters [Greek, a•del•phai´], too, are they not all here with us?’” (On the basis of this text, would you conclude that Jesus was Mary’s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters?)

The New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967, Vol. IX, p. 337) admits regarding the Greek words a•del•phoi´ and a•del•phai´, used at Matthew 13:55, 56, that these “have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the Greek-speaking world of the Evangelist’s time and would naturally be taken by his Greek reader in this sense. Toward the end of the 4th century (c. 380) Helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to Mary other children besides Jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families. St. Jerome, motivated by the Church’s traditional faith in Mary’s perpetual virginity, wrote a tract against Helvidius (A.D. 383) in which he developed an explanation . . . that is still in vogue among Catholic scholars.”
Mark 3:31-35, JB: “His mother and brothers now arrived and, standing outside, sent in a message asking for him. A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him, ‘Your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you’. He replied, ‘Who are my mother and my brothers?’ And looking round at those sitting in a circle about him, he said, ‘Here are my mother and my brothers. Anyone who does the will of God, that person is my brother and sister and mother.’” (Here a clear distinction is drawn between Jesus’ natural brothers and his spiritual brothers, his disciples. No one claims that the reference to Jesus’ mother means anything different from what it says. Is it consistent, then, to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins? When what is meant is not brothers but relatives, a different Greek word [syg•ge•non´] is used, as at Luke 21:16.)",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

I think so, don't see what it adds.  08:20, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Yes. Moreover, it is not an example of random variable. Its just a realization of random variable. Hardly misleading.  17:59, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I thought this was very useful because it showed an example where the map was not the identity map. I propose putting it back.   

False statement

A continuous random variable does not always have a density.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.4.140.135   

Definition
I dont like the definition here, not that I'm letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting, but could this be considered a clearer definition?:

""""Random Variable

The outcome of an experiment need not be a number, for example, the outcome when a coin is tossed can be 'heads' or 'tails'. However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated.

There are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous.

A random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable).

I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) 

The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. The above definition is far better on both counts and so I will put it on the page.   

BTW, sorry about the no summary edit, I hit the enter key accidentally.   

Examples

 A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted. X can only take the values 0, 1, ..., 10, so X is a discrete random variable.
 A light bulb is burned until it burns out. The random variable Y is its lifetime in hours. Y can take any positive real value, so Y is a continuous random variable. 
""""

I think the above definition (for the original reference, pls search via google) explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value, rather like a numeric index to a database record. This would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. The earler Wikiedia definition led me to comment on another Wikipedia definition incorrectly because I think I may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this Wikipedia definition.

A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. This example:

just assigns another event to an event. Could we change it to something like:

Consider a game where if a 6 is rolled on a fair six-sided die, player 1 wins, and otherwise, player 2 wins. Let X represent the number of times player 1 wins. Then

and

or maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? What do you think?

 Super Bowl Loss 

The recent Super Bowl loss is a highly significant event in the history of the Patriots franchise. The opening section discusses the """"dynasty"""" status of the Patriots, but hardly mentions the effect of the recent loss. This page has featured status for fair and proper discussion of important Patriots facts. However, the page now feels unbalanced and biased due to its brief and perfunctory coverage of this highly significant loss. It is beginning to feel like a protected fan page, as opposed to a balanced and factual discussion of important facts relating to the Patriots. Obviously the page should be protected from vandalism by Giants fans, but this page needs to acknowledge that the Patriots lost a game that many football experts are calling one of the greatest upsets of all time.  137.159.153.35  DLOMME 02/06/08
Yup.  communicator/kills 

 Taunting Disguised as Factual Information 

Looking through the history of edits since the Super Bowl, a lot of information that's being added (and much of it since deleted) may be true, but the inclusion of it into the article seems more like a subtle attempt at taunting.  Is it really relevant that the Patriots are the first 18-1 team NOT to win the Super Bowl?    Who cares?  And believe me, I'm no Patriots fan (they've been a thorn in my team's side since last season's playoffs), but this is supposed to be an encyclopedia entry, not a fan forum.  This page should be locked from any further edits for awhile, unless something TRULY relevant to the Patriots should suddenly occur.   
Actually, protection is not something to be taken lightly.  Being an admin (and even though I am a die-hard Pats fan myself), the level of problematic edits to this article, while high, is not so bad that we haven't been able to keep up with it by rollbacks and undos.  .talk.contribs

This article is starting to get vandilized again. If it were up to me I would make it temporarly semiprotected. I wonder why vandilism is returning to it. Get over it people, the superbowl's over!!!

 Bias?? 

The Franchise history section seems to be a little biased against the Patriots.  Whenever a Superbowl loss is mentioned, the opposing team and score are given.  When it gets to the part about the Patriots winning Superbowls not only are the teams/scores not given, but it doesn't even say that they won them.  ie: """"Under Belichick, the team went to''' three Super Bowls in four years...""""  It should be consistant one way or the other.

The sentence, """"The Patriots, however, were defeated by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, after winning the first 18 games of their 2007 season.""""  is very clumsily tacked on to the first section.

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Do prototypes necessarily use a sort of """"prototyping"""" material? Aren't models made of a different material called a mockup or something of the sort? In that case, the chef example above doesn't work - the new creations are prototypes. 
As for the others, the newspaper industry does use prototypes. That is, the first version referred to above. The first version is the definition of prototype - the prototype is the first version.
The coal industry could benefit greatly from prototypes, and I'm sure they use them already. There are immense safety concerns, to name one only area in which a model, perhaps not full-sized, of a coal mine would work. Additionally, the coal mines themselves are not the only asset of the coal industry - you have countless types of vehicles, mining equipment, and support equipment.
Milking cows - there would of course be no cow prototypes, as cows are not the product of the dairy industry. Instead, milk is. And I would hope there is prototype milk - a sample of the milk throughout its development cycle to make sure it is safe and clean.
As for pet stores, it is right that they would doubtless have a need for a prototype. However, a prototype is used for a product. A pet store has no """"products"""", instead they offer a service. They do not produce pets, they recieve and sell them. Even pet breeders do not produce the pets, they just reap the benefits of reproduction.

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

Point taken about the importance of the ecological roots. Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:

Sustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.

Sustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).

 stuff like Enzyme? refers to their sound as mainly being 'darkcore', as do a number of sites online. is this related to the old uk stylee darkcore or just a coincidence?

Darkcore (I talk of the early 1990s) is getting to the hardcore once meant breakbeat in England thing again - that meaning """"dark breakbeat"""" (and 
happycore for """"happy breakbeat""""). Darkcore, an old shortlived 1993 English style from Top Buzz and that - moody haunting minimalistic breakbeat with deep sub bass. That exact evolution goes into Drum & Bass. Check these links as there's various audio samples for this darkcore breakbeat. > and

If there is recent things coming out of Europe called """"Darkcore"""" I would assume it just happens to share the same term but could perhaps have a loose musical relation to the old English style. I really could not say about Enzyme and most things of today what they are. 

Really there's few people speak of darkcore / happycore in the true old form 
unless they were around back then. The music has long since gone. It's getting to a stage there's less and less names for all this stuff and names  will become more duplicated in the future - but sound different. 

 would it be acceptable to remove the paragraph regarding happy hardcore from the hardcore techno article?

Unsure - certainly English happy hardcore (breakbeat) is not a sub-variant of 
hardcore techno BUT happy hardcore has a load of different meanings all over the place in different countries. They could easily be talking about """"happy gabber"""" (happy meaning melodius and hardcore meaning gabber), things like """"I Wanna Be A Hippy"""" type-stuff, as opposed to something else.

 how 'correct' is it to have hardcore techno in the industrial music footer template. 

I do think there is some relation from its very early origins. I am however no industrial fan - so have no idea.

Clearly you are unfamiliar with Pope John XXIII, the pontiff who facilitated Vatican II in the early 1960's, and who intentionally refused to refer to the Catholic Church as the """"Roman"""" Catholic Church.  It is equally patently obvious you know nothing about Father McBrien or Charles Whitehead.

 Letter to the Governing Body on controversial points 

I thought you might like to see this. It's a letter the Governing Body received in 1980 from the Watch Tower's chairman's committee, before the Governing Body disfellowshipped many senior Witnesses for """"apostasy"""", and the reason was they were discussing these teachings below. I happen to agree with the points that disagree with traditional Watch Tower doctrine. You would also find it interesting reading Raymond Franz's discussion of each of these points in his two books, Crisis of Conscience and In search of Christian Freedom, and after see if you can still refute them using the Bible as your guide. The letter is below:

Following are some of the wrong teachings being spread as emanating from Bethel. These have been brought to the attention of the Governing Body from the field from April 14 onward.

1. That Jehovah does not have an organization on earth today and its Governing Body is not being directed by Jehovah.

2. Everyone baptized from Christ's time (C.E. 33) forward to the end should have the heavenly hope. All these should be partaking of the emblems at Memorial time and not just those who claim to be of the anointed remnant.

3. There is no proper arrangement as a """"faithful and discreet slave"""" class made up of the anointed ones and their Governing Body to direct affairs of Jehovah's people. At Matthew 24:45 Jesus used this expression only as an illustration of faithfulness of individuals. Rules are not needed only follow the Bible.

4. There are not two classes today, the heavenly class and those of the earthly class also called """"other sheep"""" at John 10:16

5. That the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation 7:4 and 14:1 is symbolic and not to be taken as literal. Those of the """"great crowd"""" mentioned at Revelation 7:9 also serve in heaven as indicated in vs. 15 where it is claimed that such crowd serves """"day and night"""" in his temple (naos) or K. int says: """"in the divine habitation of him.""""

6. That we are now living in a special period of """"last days"""" but that the """"last days"""" started 1900 years ago C.E. 33 as indicated by Peter at Acts 2:17 when he quoted from the prophet Joel.

7. That 1914 is not an established date. Christ Jesus was not enthroned then but has been ruling in his kingdom since C.E.33. That Christ's presence (parousia) is not yet but when the """"sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven"""" (Matthew 24:30) in the future.

8. That Abraham, David, and other faithful men of old will also have the heavenly life basing such view on Hebrews 11:16.

The POV concern is because both the Canadian and US Air force counter-claims state current activities /capabilities. Neither refutes or try to explain the theorists belief that there were Cold War activities as theorized and that chem-trails are an extension of it.  Canada had the Suffolk Experimental Station and were the specialists in the field of Large Area Coverage. The CBW aspect is mentioned in the Lead but not the body-a policy issue.  Another policy issue is that a reference is listed but not used in the entry.  When the CBW info is introduced, you might see a obvious correlation in Declassification/public disclosure and theorists claims and Official responses in the late 1970s, mid-90s, early 2003.

Hi Crzrussian: Only if you want to also include Malcolm X (involved in drug dealing, gambling, pimping, racketeering, and robbery); Marion Barry (convicted of drug charges); Eldridge Cleaver (convicted of assault with intent to murder); Angela Davis (charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and homicide); Bobby Seale (conspiracy and inciting to riot, sentenced to four years imprisonment for contempt of court) and MANY others in USA. Since NONE of the individuals mentioned with CLEAR criminal records are categorized as criminals, which they clearly were, neither should Kahane be stigmatized for his ACTIVISM. He was not doing anything to harm the USA, in his view he was acting, to help Jews remain or become FREE from oppression be they in Israel, the USSR or the USA. Can the same be said about the Black activists who chanted and lived by """"burn baby burn"""" yet are listed in glowing wonderful categories without any mention that they were and are real-life CONVICTED criminals? You CANNOT have a double standard. It seems the editors dealing with the articles about the convicted Black """"activists"""" new not to class them as criminals of any sort, so why are you so obssessed with doing this to Kahane?

 Korean articles 
Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

I don't think I'm the one most in need of a lecture about not seeing the forest for the trees.

Look, Duk, if you want to take on the job of my reeducation, I can probably talk to you about it.  

But if you want to do so, first we need a solid foundation on which to build the discussions.  Let's stick to what is known about why I was blocked, okay?
JzG blocked me because I complained, in a point incidental to a separate complaint, on a complaints noticeboard, that Rlevse was rude and inconsiderate in his actions towards me.  We know that because JzG came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse blocked me because I had not responded on Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts.  We know that because he came right here and said that was why he was blocking me.
We also know it because Rlevse went to WQA and said that was why he was blocking me.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at Wikipedia talk:Call a spade a spade.
Rlevse did not go and make any such explanation at User talk:ArielGold

Now, maybe I just missed it, but I don't think there is anything at Wikipedia:Blocking policy saying that the decision to block is something entirely at the administrator's whim, or that the administrator should
Block now.  You can always invent a reason for it later.
or anything along those lines.  So let's just stick with what is actually known and knowable about he reason for which I was blocked, the things that had been documented and recorded in our various histories here at Wikipedia before I was blocked.  Anything else is irrelevant.

Don't invent new reasons for a block.  At the same time, don't say that the stated reasons for a block were not the reasons for it.

For that matter, if Rlevse had wanted to take on that job, and had felt that there was something he wanted to teach me, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  He did not do so.  If JzG had wanted to take on that job, he likewise could have tried to talk to me.  But he took it one step further than Rlevse did; JzG did make a comment addressed to something I said, but then he blocked me to prevent me from responding to his own comment.   22:13",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

This refers to Talk:Sentence spacing#BRD discussion for edit 402814700.
You are writing too much and not directly responding to text written by others. In my comment that you mention above, I point out that you had posted 8 times in 24 hours on the talk page of an article concerned with the practice of using one space or two spaces between sentences. Furthermore, those posts came after a lot of other talk page activity; that much discussion is not warranted.
May I make a suggestion? Regular editors here see far too much irrelevant commentary, and their brains go into automatic after reading a couple of off-topic sentences. You are inadvertently obfuscating your point because you preface it with too much extraneous material. For a practical illustration of what I mean, I suggest that you should either comment here about my style (and if you like, request opinions at WP:WQA), or comment at Talk:Sentence spacing on a single point that relates to improving the article. It would be best to not mention jargon like """"BRD"""" because it only obfuscates your point. For example, if you think something in the article should be changed, just clearly describe the change, then explain what is wrong with the old text, then explain why the new text is better (with any references).

Maurice Renaud;  Whistle-register nonsense

I am glad you liked the Battistini article. Please see the new Maurice Renaud creation.

I want to propose deleting category:Whistle register singers.

 

What to do about the Unchangeable??

I just happened upon the article related to the legendary 19th Century Italian tenor, MARIO. It identifies him as """"Giuseppe [sic] Mario""""!

Appart from being an embarrasment, this presuposes that """"Mario"""" had a first name, which he didn't, not on stage, anyway. MARIO appeared on stage simply as plain MARIO. In any case his private Christian name was NOT Giuseppe but Giovanni. His birth name was Giovanni Matteo di Candia. This article also calls Giovanni Battista Rubini Alessandro Rubini...obviously whoever set it up had it in for the name John!

I would just correct the body of the article, but the problem is that up on top, that is to say, the reference title, says """"Giuseppe Mario"""", which I don't think can be changed.

Any suggestions?   

 Mario 

Fine, but there never was a """"Giovanni Matteo Mario"""": it was just plain MARIO, stage name of Giovanni Matteo di Candia.  
Just got your message - we can put him as Mario (tenor). Is that OK? (No harm in having multiple redirects - which are created automatically when we move articles.) - Kleinzach  

I think that would be ideal. Thanks. Please see my little article on Les Indes galantes and feel free to suggest any improvements.

 

Les Indes galantes

I used the schematic template given at your Opera Project site. 

I'm afraid I don't quite understand """"we need to write it up, rather than leave it in note form"""". Do you mean the synopsis? Of course, plots of French baroque operas are semi-non-existent, so they are very hard to detail without boggling the mind. Half of the action is allegorical dance, anyway.

 

If you look at any Encyclopedia under the heading """"Napoleon"""""""", you are not going to find the sentence """"Napoleon was an Emperor of the French"""", which sounds idiotic, kind of like """"Dubarry was a lady"""", but """"Napoleon, emperor of the French"""". 

Similarly, If you look up Idomeneo, Re di Creta in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, it does not say """"Idomeneo, Re di Creta is an opera in 3 acts by Mozart""""; it actually says Idomeneo, Re di Creta. Opera in 3 acts by Mozart; text by G. B. Varesco, after Danchet's libretto for Campra's Idomenée (1712) and the ancient legend.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",1,0,0,0,0,0,toxic

I was being blocked on editing and everything was reverted, many glaring inaccuracies remaining in the article. I was accused of not discussing first on the discussion page before editing, and a term paper by a Harvard Law Student quoting chunks of a non-available secondary source (book costing $1 400) was not acceptable (""""a term paper is not ok for Wikipedia""""(although thírd-hand quotes from the BBC and newspapers were). I had rewritten the article (as an anonymous non-signed in user) from top to bottom and it was reverted, and every subsequent minor edit was reversed. As I researched the existing references in the footnotes I could see how selective the writers of the article had been, and started to discover that the main points in the reference material had been glossed over and omitted, and peripheral information (such as Grandin's memory of horrific conditons that are no more) presented and headed as Criticism [presumably of shehitah as such] Rather than thinking to the bottom of what had happened historically, it was a cut-and-paste job of whatever happened to supprt one POV. When Jews have been living in Sweden since the 1700s, they were banned from slaughtering because they were regarded as not being properly Swedish, Lapps could slaughter with a knife because they were """"Swedish"""" and this matter is dealt with by Ethnologists and Anthropologists, but totally absent in the article.

Welcome to Wikipedia, !  My name is Ryan, aka . I noticed that you were new and haven't received any messages yet. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Wikipedia can be a little intimidating at first, since it uses different formatting than other sites that use HTML and CSS. In the long run, though, you'll find that the WikiSyntax is a lot easier and faster than those other ways. Here are a few links to get you started:

How to edit a page
Editing, policy, conduct, and structure tutorial
Picture tutorial
How to write a great article

There are a lot of policies and guides to read, but I highly recommend reading over those first. If you have any questions, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page. Please be sure to sign your name on Talk Pages using four tildes (~~~~) to produce your name and the current date, along with a link to your user page. This way, others know when you left a message and how to find you. It's easier than having to type out your name, right? )

Disruption

Sysops may block IP addresses or usernames that disrupt the normal functioning of Wikipedia, or pose any kind of threat to it. Such disruption may include (but is not limited to) changing other users' signed comments, making deliberately misleading edits, harassment, excessive personal attacks, and inserting material that may be defamatory. Users will normally be warned before they are blocked.

 Writer attribution for Lennon/McCartney songs 

Your edit comments that """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, except for the rule that the lead singer is the dominant writer"""" and """"Authorship of Beatles's songs is difficult to ascertain precisely, since all four, plus George Martin and others, were frequently involved in the crafting"""" are wrong on several counts.

 The official, legal credits are easy to determine: Lennon/McCartney except for some early songs which were originally credited to McCartney/Lennon. Ample sources exist and the WP infoboxes show the official L/M (or M/L) credit.
 Who actually wrote the song is pretty easy to determine for most of the songs where there is no dispute between L and M. Using various interviews and biographies as sources, L and M say what their part was. For a small minority of songs, such as """"Eleanor Rigby"""", L and M disagreed and the article describes the disputed authorship. For cases where there was a 60/40 split, adverbs like """"predominantly"""" or """"mainly"""" make sense, but not in cases where there is no dispute that L or M was the sole author.
 While it is true that the lead singer was often the main writer of an L/M song, it is not always true. """"Every Little Thing"""" is one such exception.
 Other people who contribute to a song—such as a producer or soloist—typically do not get a writing credit for their contribution. That's standard practice in the industry with rare exceptions, and there are good reasons for it. When someone makes a significant contribution, that should be discussed in the prose or in the Personnel section, i.e., """"Martin wrote the string arrangement"""" or whatever.

Your position on the L/M situation is a minority viewpoint. The authorship details you are challenging are typical of hundreds of articles that have similar prose and use similar evidence and the text in those articles have been accepted by many WP editors. That represents a strong consensus for identifying the actual author in the prose. You should seek consensus for your changes and present reliable sources that support your view. —   """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Hey  Kuru, 

There is  something really wrong with the administration of Wikipedia, and I am not the only one to know about and complains!.

For quite a while I had been hesitant but after a comment by a Polish Wikipedian I was finally encouraged to leave Polish Wikipedia (for some time only perhaps). I decided to move to the English Wikipedia for a change.

Regards,
Kpjas (talk) 

Although I am aware that  he (Kpjas)  have his  """"own problems"""" for some it might be a positive development!

I want to remind you that in US  at one time they needed to block the IP of US gov ... because  the politicians were polishing their resumes and were using the Wikipedia as they election platform!

You Have responded to  my  comments (in a way positively).

The problem is still that bunch of  administrators have  NO idea what the hell they  are talking about.

Please read my comments  and make  appropriate  corrections as  a shoddy  communist agent's tabloid operating the disinformation campaign shall NEVER  be called  a prominent newspaper!
You do not call a clochard a prince and prince a clochard!
There is to much crap like this specially  related to abuse by the polish administrators  who are  either  connected with the propaganda machine or are brain washed. 

As  an expert on many issues I believe that all  IPs  of some bloody idiots from  Poland should be banned for all other languages so we will have the real and unbiased by the people who do not understand what is Freedom, Liberty and Democracy and  vandalize the web pages with their totalitarian communist bias after being brain washed   since 1945 by several decades from generation to generation and educated by the communist teachers!

Galloglass, I understand your concerns. However, the only example of the retention of previous electoral results was with the Bennelong example (which is a historically important seat; oweing to the fact that the previous minister was indeed Prime Minister Howard, who had held for the seat over 3 decades, and no other PM has lost his seat since Stanely Bruce) so I therefore felt it would be widely understood that the removal of the previous election results from the page would be acceptable. The 2004 Election results remain on many multiple pages because no-one has updated these pages, and this is what I am striving to do. 

If you feel that my actions are incorrect (which I can completely understand from your perspective), maybe you could create a new page (much like the one for Bennelong) and list the 2004 and earlier Election results here.

Oh, what a mess. Multiple formats bedevil the writing of a logically-structured encyclopedia! I can see valid arguments for maintaining (although how much that needs to be done is moot) different chronologies for UK and US releases, because of the various Columbia chop-ups that were released in the early years, but trying to keep them in step is an arduous task. Most Beatles albums tend to be listed in order of their UK release (which usually preceded other locations), and that, per WP:ENGVAR, should IMHO be the norm as regards principal chronology. There's no issue with listing colonial releases in the main article, but little to be gained in having separate articles. As regards this one, as far as the UK is concerned, it was a double EP, and I see no problem in describing that initial release as an """"album"""", for simplicity's sake, and all variations should follow from that.

Sure, there are some trigger-happy people about, and new editors should be treated with every consideration; but to me this doesn't mean we accept any self-publicity, trivia or opinionated diatribes they care to post.

So it may appear """"hostile"""" to those whose expectations are formed in using those other websites.

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

 Edit request on 26 February 2012 

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a syndrome in which children have abrupt, dramatic onset of Tourette's Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or anorexia nervosa coincident with the presence of two or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.  It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.

  
No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you've extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette's, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I'm a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn't belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk)

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0,0,0,0,0,1,identity_hate

In case you are stupid as well as paranoid and a coward, speaking face to face is the old fashoined way of sorting out problems as opposed to hiding behind a pretty name in a cyber veil; you pathetic little excuse for a man.   —Preceding unsigned comment added by Gregjay (talk • contribs)

Assyrian people are not all, or may not be, 100% ethnically Assyrian and may be descended of one or more of the following: the Assyrians and/or the people that they conquered, and/or of the people that conquered them. With the ancient people, there really would be no way to prove the lineage unless one was to unearth many ancient graves, examine and carbon date the remains, compare the DNA of the different graves, and then come up with a comparative analisys of the ancient peoples' DNA to that of the modern-day people. With the latter day arrivals of conquerors it is possible that they may have had some influence as well for at first a lot of the anscestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian and/or converts, and the area they ruled remained predominantly Christian with Syriac as the lingua franca up until the Islamic conquests. Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity. That tactic was borrowed and applied by the Persians, and by many empires that followed, including the United States, with its former policy against Native Americans of relocating them to Reservations. Ironically, this has been the fate of the modern-day people. The Ba'ath parties of Iraq, Syria, and to a lesser extent, Syria's influence and interference in Lebanese affairs, were adament in replacing all ethnic identities with an Arab Nationalistic identity.

Flori provides a footnote for this statement, with references to several authors. Since this article very carefully documents its sources, with citations to specific pages, it still seems to that the text in the article should correspond to the citation.

 Jorge Gracie 
The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug! 
You can userfy it over here.  I will update it and improve it. Buddy23Lee you can perform fixes to it as well.  Make it a complete article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyAces489/jorgegracie

OK finally got around to typing this.

1. The Forgotten was released as an official single for the Twilight soundtrack. I think most people remove it because they think it was a ¡Tré! single, which it wasnt. Green Day announced a while back, along with Twilight, That it would be the soundtracks lead single.
2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion. And as for the other we had an agreement a while back to keep this one but people have started removing it again. This was a collaboration from Green Day and Husker Du. It was an """"official released Split single"""". One side was the original version and the other Green Days version from """"Warning"""". But either way both are sourced and the source is reliable and many other sources on this page come from this site as well. 
This one I dont see any complaints about. It never had a war to remove and only was reverted a while back. Various other ones have this section and its not that long. So it doesnt make the page to huge and not every discography """"has to have one"""". I dont think that this is a problem and it really does make the article more complete. The only thing missing is demos if we want to add them.

 So this is what I think and what do you say about adding demos. Its not to many and wouldnt be a problem with sources and what not.
I also think we should add Cigarettes and Valentines to the studio albums page and put """"Unreleased"""" I added it once but one person didnt like it and kept reverting it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

1990–1992: Early commercial success
Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career. The album debuted low on t",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

The original comment is absolutely correct - """"global warming"""" without any qualification should refer to any planet at any point in space-time. Most of space-time is inaccessible to us, at least in practice, but for example an article titled """"Global warming"""" should at least include the timing, cause(s) and progress of GW on Venus and at various times in the Earth's history when geochmical and fossil evidence indicate that GW probably occurred.
Of course that's only logic. I don't expect it will change the content of this article or lead to most of its current content being moved to e.g. """"The debate about contemporary global warming on Earth"""".    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Yes, just recently, we proposed renaming the page from Transsexuality to Transsexualism, so it appears to be a very controversial issue.  As the Definitions section of this article suggests, not everyone will be happy with any single term.  For examples, Jennifer Diane Reitz refers to """"transsexuality"""" and Lynn Conway refers to """"transsexualism.""""  If you search """"transsexuality"""" and """"transsexualism"""" on Google, you will find more hits for """"transsexualism.""""  Reality Resources, an ex-trans ministry, frequently uses """"transsexuality,"""" and to me, """"transsexuality"""" sounds like a sexual orientation.  Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term """"interest in feminization"""" for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Given the recent replies to this comment, and the recent move debate, I feel like consensus has already been established.

Dennis, I'd really love to hear an answer as to why my Coal edits are relevant here. I've stopped editing coal, and this consitutesDouble Jeopardy since I've already been punished for this and have done nothing since then. 

Dan is also missspeaking when he says there were 4 blocks, there were 3, and one """"change of block settings"""". Unless """"words no longer have meaning"""" to quote that great curmudgeon Antonin Scalia, that means there were 3 blocks, not 4. And this one is somewhat strange since I seem to be getting blocked again for the same problem. Obviously my edits have improved from my first week at the encylopedia, but I keep getting unloaded on for my youthful indiscretions. Also, Flyer22 has been following me around reverting my edits since I first did her the indignity of adding a minor, brief, referenced note on Sigmund Freud's theories to her beloved childhood page, which has little to no useful philosophical material, and yet is classed as a high importance, low quality philosophy, with begging for improvement (""""If you can improve this page, please do so. It has little or no material"""") then afterwards, she began to follow me around to other philosophy pages, and reverting my work with dishonest comments in the edit summary given as reasons. Yes, I did get annoyed at this, but I think it was rather uncivil to tell a new editor that their edits are """"poor, pure and simple"""" don't you? Especially when she doesn't seem to actually posssess any abiding interest in the topics I edit other than the fact that they are my topics, and she wishes to see me be annoyed and removed from editing this website?

That is the reality that the article should reflect, the policy of WP:COMMONNAME. Bradley Manning was a solider in the United States military. Bradley Manning was caught passing classified intel to unauthorized parties, convicted, and sentenced. After that, Bradley Manning decided to be called """"Chelsea"""". That is how the flow of the article should be, these are all things that a man named Bradley Manning did, you can't just flick a switch and rewrite history to say """"Chelsea Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act..."""" and so on. That just isn't historically accurate or truthful. When and if he legally changes his name, that is when the transition process of the article should begin. That all was simply way too soon.

In the serie shown as she is an amazing woman and how she began her extraordinary career, her struggle against racism and his triumph by winning as a woman in a musical world where only men was excelled, in the series is also shows how she begins conquering the world with his unique style and powerful voice, reasons that becomes her the legitimate icon of Latinos Worldwide.

Yep. LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

The section suggesting that the myth originated via the constellations should, I think, be deleted.  Besides being an over-simplification of the complexities of mythology, it is wrong.  Astrology, though which mythological significance might be applied to the stars, did not arrive in Greece until the 4th c. BC, hundreds of years after the principle formation of the myth.  Therefore, the constellations could not have been the foundation of the myth, but are instead an aftereffect of it, a novel way of using the myth at a later time.MS",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

""""nina phunsta"""" is associated with IF Records so there is a clear conflict of interest. 

A Google search for nina phunsta adequately demonstrates the above claim when reading through various posts on forums. 
Various forum profiles of nina phunsta contain the IF Records website in their signature. This is in contrast to previous claims that Andrez Bergen is a former writing colleague on nina phunsta's talk page . 

""""DSK 1984"""" is harder to pinpoint as it is a relatively newer handle but a Google search presents forum posts mostly related to IF records. 

As for the Little Nobody page:
 ^ Wayward Seafarers Review, Chris Downton. 3D World, June 2008.
This review does not exist on the 3D World website, the link is to the homepage of that website. There are no other external links under references that can be used to verify any of the text on the Wikipedia page. Some of the articles cited are recent so a link to the article on the web version of the newspapers should be provided. The ABC artist profile is the only reliable source and is dated, from 2003 and refers only to a local dance music scene. Many of the links under External Links are broken. 

Much of the information appears to be fabricated as it does not appear anywhere else when performing a Google search. 
Colloquial language in background information: """"Website TABLittle Nobody's dodgy MySpace site"""". This indicates that the article is largely a puff piece. 

Thus, articles related to Little Nobody and IF Records should be removed for:
1. not meeting notability guidelines; and
2. being written in an advertising format
3. large amounts of unverifiable information
  

 (1) No admin has denied the speedy yet but (although it was tagged 12 or more hours ago) neither has anyone deleted it.  I agree that it's spam and deserves deletion.  The problem may be that, promotional puffery that it is, it's been around for so long, but that can cut both ways.  —   ✉

I regret that it has been changed back. I think I have written a clear and correct representation of metahysical libertarianism. Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.

But on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

Cultural note

Uruguay is notable that as well as its national anthem, various of its departments have also adopted their own anthems in an effort to promote civic identity and responsibility.

Writer and composer

The words and music of the anthem are written by Danilo Pallares Echeverría.

Description

The hymn consists of three stanzas, two of eight lines and one of nine lines. 

They describe and celebrate the Flores Department's beauty and the achievements of its people. These are linked to the patriotic values of the Uruguayan nation. 

Beyond Uruguay, universal values of humanity are evoked as being encapsulated in the Flores Department.

I went and summarized the source in my own words:
Science shows that the Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. The organisms that live on Earth have completely changed its air (atmosphere); this is called a biosphere. 71% of Earth's surface is covered in salt water oceans. Earth is the only place in the Solar System where liquid water is known to exist at present. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands.

Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, particularly the Sun and the Moon. The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a day and one orbit around the Sun is called a year. This is why there are 365 days in a year, but a leap day is added once every 4 years.

 Secrets from the grave 

This is pure speculation on my part, but I imagine the exhumation of Paula's grave would have been carried out under conditions of great secrecy and with some degree of security. Nonetheless, I wonder if DNA obtained from any remains might yield a clue as to the identity of the grandfather she shared with her infamous brother. Would anyone be interested enough to do the research? It would surely be only of academic interest, but even so...

I also find it a rather odd co-incidence that these mysterious documents have appeared, apparently within weeks of the exhumation. Is there any proof that the documents are genuine? I still recall the fiasco of the so called """"Hitler diaries"""" some years ago. Perhaps the time has come to stop looking. The subject's fascination cannot be denied, but it is surely time to move forward. TCH. UK.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,non-toxic

Sorry to resurrect this issue after a very long while, however, the example of rice perfectly illustrates my point; the current Abdul Halim is a name page, analagous to Rice (surname). As such it is a perfectly good page. However, in creating it you have removed the necessary and separate page which disambiguates between uses of the term """"Abdul Halim"""", analagous to Rice (disambiguation): Abdul Halim (disambiguation) is currently a redirect to Abdul Halim, which is not a disambiguation page as it does not follow the disambiguation guidelines I referred to above. Also, by placing the name page at Abdul Halim, you give it the status of primary topic. It is more likely that one of the other uses should be there, or it should be the disambiguation page. I suggest you correct your edits to be in line with current guidelines by moving the current Abdul Halim to Abdul Halim (name) and creating a new disambiguation page at Abdul Halim, following the guidelines at WP:D and MOS:D.

If you look at my changes today, I included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults (one of whom has a Wikipedia article already) with three independent sources for Track’s birth date of 20 April 1989, and I included the birth date for baby Trig, since he was SO MUCH in the news last year. I was trying to find a compromise position. There is no consensus here for including or for excluding, and, if you read previous talk pages, you will see no consensus there either.

In the spirit of erring on the side of more information (Wikipedia’s mission is to inform, after all), I made today’s revision. The immediate reversion, wiping out all birth dates, except that of little Tripp Johnston (certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all), is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either. As for the sources, I shall find better ones, but that argument is a red herring. No one has found any other birth date for Track other than 20 April 1989. All the sources (weaker or stronger) agree on the birth date.

I have read WP:UNDUE. It supports including neutral factual information. Birth dates fall into that category. I really don’t see where the problem is here. I shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article, but this demonstrates that Wiki-articles need more consistent management.

 Górny & Rosiknoń Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations Into Christ’s Relics 

Several editors tried to prevent including material from that book, voicing an opinion of the authors that """"the results of numerous time-consuming and comprehensive analyses, conducted using the most technologically advanced equipment available, seemed to coincide with assertions prevalent in Christian tradition."""", under the pretext of RS. For discussion of the matter, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_a_book_by_a_journalist_and_a_photographer_a_reliable_source_for_an_analysis_of_religious_relics.3F 

Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher, I don't know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia -except someone's hostility to Catholicism. If we exclude Górny, then we should also exclude Carrol-Cruz -catholic writer as well, and Nickell, sceptical writer, who is much more biased (against any relics) than any Catholic source -so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article. The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral. To balance it, we have posititve Górny&Rosiko;ń opinion from 2013 -much more recent, after several researches on some relics (described in their book) have been published.

Have you actually read my post on the Winter Palace which is completely calm and constructive or are you so wrapped up in yourself? The fact is that most administrators here lack YM's sense of justice in favour of being popular. He did not care about being in with the crowd like you Mr. Vulcan but always sought to do what was best for editors. Your block is the most pointless thing you can do to me, and given that the issue over Winter Palace seems to be ceasing once again it extremely poorly mistimed. You lack the judgement to be an adminstrator Mr. Vulcan and I find it very sad indeed the only time you ever visit my tlak page is to block me. The admins presiding over this case should be ridiculed for their failure to adhere to WP:OWN or even warn Giano about it.

 As for your substantive proposal, I agree that significant coverage in multiple sources is the GNG standard, but the sources don't have to be presented before an article can be created.  For example, I created 1892 Harvard Crimson football team knowing that significant coverage exists in multiple sources, but for starting purposes I considered it sufficient to have citations to reliable sources such as the Harvard site and CFDW.  Hopefully, another editor will pick up the baton and expand further, but I don't see how or why an article such as 1892 Harvard should be a candidate for deletion when a search of The New York Times archives of newspapers.com turns up a plethora of coverage for the topic. Stubs are not where we end up, but sometimes they serve a useful purpose in getting things started.

Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,

Why are so many of you acting like 8 year olds and ruining what used to be a decent page on Steve Jobs?  

His father was Paul Jobs - what dumb idiot called Justin changed it to Justin Paul Jobs?

He was born in San Francisco - look up the 2006 archives.

The purchase of what was later named Pixar, from Lucas, is fully covered in the archives.  The price, the date etc. From the official sales records.

Bitch, stop spreading your Mongol propaganda. Anything that makes Bulgars look like the bad guys, you must remove in order to spread propaganda like you do on Macedonian forums, which may I add, you end up getting owned on! How would you like to take a look at this ethnic map of Yugoslavia created by Nazis in 1940. Macedonians is included as a seperate ethnic group! 

There it is, right under Bulgaren... """"Mazedonier"""", no?... Let's have a closer look shall we?

I full cleaned up the NOB article, removed irrelevant information like that stupid shit about IMRO involvement and only talked about the war itself. Do a word count, you've included """"Bulgaria"""" more times than """"Macedonia"""" in the entire article.
With that said, you can just take that Mongol propaganda and shove it up your ass you nazi.""",1,0,1,0,1,0,toxic

Never going to happen, so you might as well give up on that tidbit, and again, I stand by what I say.  At the time you left the comment, he had gone to bed.  That doesn't give you the right to be an absolute jerk to him and insult him just because he didn't respond instantly.  As to why he hasn't responded further, that is quite obvious: he already explained to you his reasoning.  He does not have to defend himself to you, and you are the only person who thinks he is abusive.  I don't expect you to apologize, but know this, if you continue on the path you are on now, you will get blocked.— dαlus Contribs 
You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.
