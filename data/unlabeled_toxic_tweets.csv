This is NOT the correct definition of queer.  According to the free dictionary dot com, queer is """"Deviating from the expected or normal; strange: a queer situation. 2. Odd or unconventional, as in behavior; eccentric. See Synonyms at strange.""""  And according to Merriam-Webster, queer means """"a  differing in some odd way from what is usual or normal. b (1)  eccentric, unconventional (2)  mildly insane  touched.""""

109320,48a6c963fdfc9aad,""": Hi Hanely, and others,

First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the """"weasel words"""" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is """"true.""""  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  """"Plagiarism"""" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for """"Science"""" and """"Revelation"""".  For instance, one thing that can be done for """"Revelation"""" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  """"Peacock terms"""" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.

What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything """"pro"""".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.

I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.

On the points you brought up, my thoughts:

1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.

2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sehend and Babakkhorramdin currently appear to be engaged in an edit war. Note that the three-revert rule prohibits making more than three reversions in a content dispute within a 24 hour period. Additionally, users who perform a large number of reversions in content disputes may be blocked for edit warring, even if they do not technically violate the three-revert rule. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing. Please do not repeatedly revert edits, but use the talk page to work towards wording and content that gains a consensus among editors. If necessary, pursue dispute resolution. This has nothing to do with the merits of the dispute, it has to do with cooperative editing.   

Dear 
Thanks for your message. I didn't start editing war.  started it by forcing Persian script to Azeris. even we accept persian script, He added a word that is not grammatically correct in Azeri with Persian script. to solve it i added west Azerbaijan translation in Azeri in both Latin and persian scripts. i don't know why he thinks we should follow his idea to use Fazeri (a fake language which uses completely Persian words with one azeri verb at the end). For instance in Azeri similar to English adjective comes first followed by a noun. But in Farsi noun comes first.  wanted to force Perisan words for west( غربی )and Azerbaijan(آذربایجان) and suggests using غربی آذربایجان. hence, we don't use غ as the first word in Azeri.    22:35",0,0,0,0,0,0

But I haven't denied that at all! I am myself a subject who considers himself both french and spaniard... with both breton and Asturian  roots... So what? Of course there are roussillonese who may consider themselves catalan without stopping feeling french... I'm just saying that there are no references of studies or scholars (apart that GREC article) to back the sentence in the lead of the article: """"Other Catalan-speaking people from the Pays Catalan in southern France, Andorrans or Valencians are sometimes included in a Catalan ethnic group"""". That sentence is so freely included in wikipedia is just doesn't fit. We could also said that 3/4 of the spaniards may """"also be included in a Almoravid ethnic root""""... I'm sorry, but that is just too POVish.

Let me copy/paste here the first paragraphs of the """"Explanation of the neutral point of view section"""" in Wikipedia:Neutral point of view:

""""The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting verifiable perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources. The policy requires that where multiple or conflicting perspectives exist within a topic each should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being judged as """"the truth"""", in order that the various significant published viewpoints are made accessible to the reader, not just the most popular one. It should also not be asserted that the most popular view, or some sort of intermediate view among the different views, is the correct one to the extent that other views are mentioned only pejoratively. Readers should be allowed to form their own opinions.""""

""""The neutral point of view is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject: it neither endorses nor discourages viewpoints. As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. The elimination of article content cannot be justified under this policy on the grounds that it is """"POV"""". Article content should clearly describe, represent, and characterize disputes within topics, but without endorsement of any particular point of view. Articles should provide background on who believes what and why, and which view is more popular; detailed articles might also contain evaluations of each viewpoint, but must studiously refrain from taking sides.""""

So, this said, again, I'm not against including that some sources claim the other regions to have some degree of Catalanity, but, as the guideline states """"Articles should provide background on who believes what and why"""". So, my addition that is only the GREC who includes all territories as catalan is correct and, even, necessary in order to let """"Readers [...] to form their own opinions"""". The same way the article should include sources to back that some people consider all territories as catalan, it should also include sources that some others don't.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1,0,0,0,0,0

If you feel your edits might qualify as one of the small list of exceptions, please apply them with caution and ensure that anyone looking at your edits will come to the same conclusion.

My opinion on these pages is uneducated mods deleted them for invalid reasons with NO DEBATE, a pure Draconian nazi mod behavior.

The 8 Prime Spirals article is a BIG DEAL in math since it puts forth amazing information about a 1995 math theory now being used in real life computer programs to outperform all the prime algorithms wiki has pages on.

So in the world of primality IT IS A BIG DEAL.

To summarize the gross lies of wiki mods, they think a cite to a valid primality test open to debate by real academics at GITHUB is not worthy of a page creation.

LOL

So now let the mods enjoy their worthless realm of unimportance which wiki is to most in academia.

9224,188c84206d3209a6,"""Actually to clarify....after Bret Hart was forced to vacate the world title(and retire) due to a concussion, the planned Hart vs Sid Vicious title match was changed less than 48 hours before the match to Sid vs Benoit. Since there was no time to build up the match it was decided to do a screwjob finish, and then build to the rematch at Superbrawl the next month. So benoit """"won"""" the match(with Sid's leg clearly on the ropes), and then the next night on Nitro the decision was overturned. The official result of the Sould Out 2000 Main Event was """"Chris Benoit and Sid Vicious fought to a no-contest"""". End of story. Except not. Pissed off at the shitty booking, Benoit confronted booker Kevin Sullivan(who benoit had a personal history with re: Nancy). Sullivan then told Benoit if he didn't like the booking he could ask for his contract release no questions asked. benoit took him up on it and jumped to the WWF. The difference between this and the millions of other screwjob/Dusty finishes was that rather than the belt seemingly moving from one champion to the next, then being handed back....the bgelt was vacant before Benoit """"won"""" the title, thus the overturning of the decision made the belt vacant once more. Sid also had a seeming title victory only for the result to be overturned due to his """"pinning the wrong Harris"""". Officially at the time the belt went from Hart to a vacant state to Kevin Nash awarding the belt to himself........

Okay, so Vinnie Mac has bought at WCW and recognised both Benoit's and Sid's first wins as World Title Wins. He has also recognised Hulk Hogan's two AWA Dusty Finishes as official World Title Wins. I don't like it, but I guess it's official now. The obvious question is, since Vince owns WWE, WCW, ECW and AWA can he, say overturn David Arquette's WCW World Title win at this point? That's just stupid.

These taglines are not notable. According to the Style guidelines, """"As a general rule don't include taglines in an article. """"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information"""". However, if a particular tagline was a significant part of the cultural influence of the film, create a section for it and describe its effects."""" It provides an example of this as Jaws 2's tagline, """"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water..."""" which is indeed a notable tagline. The only taglines that are at all notable aren't notable because they're taglines, they're notable because they're memorable quotes from the movie.

But why does it matter? Because they are unprofessional and unecyclopedic. They make the article """"all listy,"""" which greatly detracts form its quality. This is why it has a clean-up tag. (As a side note, moving the lists to the bottom doesn't really help the problem at all.)  

I am un-willing to use your opinion as to what is notable and here is why. You are forgetting the historic refereance to the example you gave. """"A different set of Jaws"""". I am returning the deleted section. Should Wiki Admin weigh in on this, I will do what they decide. Just coming around and saying something is not this or is that, does not make it true. I ask that you provide a basis to your belief that the Taglines from Rocky Horror are not notable or are you just not familier with the film?. 
 If the taglines are culturally significant they will be quoted in a published source. I'm removing them again, per WP:REF. If you chose to re-add them, please provide citations.  

I'm sorry for the confusion, my link wasn't right: Try this. See also WP:REF and WP:N and WP:NOT. Consensus is clear that these taglines should go.  

Just exactly what do you call a consensus? Two people against one? 

 I call those links consensus. By the way, with WP:NOT I meant WP:UNENC, I should have been more specific.  

 Tag lines List re-added. Dispute of it's removal 

I am returning the Tagline list again. The Taglines from """"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"""" are both culturely significant (Don't Dream It, Be it, and Let's do the Time Warp Again, both used as song lyrics and later as tag lines for the film in Print advertisement are two of the most remembered Tags as well as the original """"A Different Set of Jaws"""") and Quoted in publications such as Time Magazine and Newspaper articles from coast to coast including the Fresno Bee, Sacramento bee and Modesto Bee, the San Francisco Chronicle as well as the New York Times. There is also the book """"The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book"""" by Bill Henkin. That does answer to both Arguements from above. I officialy dispute it's removal. This is an article about a motion picture not about an individual item. There is going to be at least two list in ALL articles about films. The cast and crew and if its a musical a song list. Where advertisement has a significant historical context or influence it is notable to add the list. The call was for a cleanup not just a mass deletion. Plus I recommend both of the above to add citations as I have. I am looking through alot of media and will be adding more.

I would like to now hear from a Wiki Admin on the subject as I believe it is the only way to end the dispute.  

You are confused on an important part of wikipedia policy: admins are not in any real position of authority. Things are decided by consensus and an admin's opinion is worth no more than any users. As I said above, consensus is clearly against you and the inclusion of these taglines.  

I am sorry but you are incorrect about what a consensus is. Please see below to the Wiki definition of Consensus. Also A true consesus takes time. More than you are allowing, per Wikipedia policy.  
 Consensus should not be for or against an individual but about the subject.  

Also, your arguments are clearly wrong. First, the taglines were not used as song lyrics, the song lyrics were used as taglines. Also, the fact that there is a book about the rocky horror show that mentions the taglines does not mean the article should.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We come again to the crucial question of what is this article about, to which I add another distinction: (a) ghetto benches considered narrowly - this particular discriminatory measure  (b) Discrimination against Jews in education in Poland (wider)  (c) Antisemitism in Polish universities, in Polish education (widest).  (b) or (c) seem to be reasonable, popular choices. This is something that people are just going to have to think hard about and come to a consensus.  What is OR depends on what we decide the article is about, since it is clear that we are using """"ghetto benches"""" a bit figuratively.  Changing the title is a possibility. Under (c), but probably not (b), the replacement from the notes that I suggested, the quote from Meltzer -""""In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.” would be acceptable.

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over

In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22.

Let's see, 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits, vs. the just over 80 years that the I.R.A. has existed, and you, in all of your wisdom decide that the 'R.A. is worse.

 INeverCry 

Thanks for the kind words. 

I've found that most of the greatest writers of all languages are unworkable here on Wikipedia; Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Brontes, Lev Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Gustave Flaubert, etc will never be GA or FA (or if they make it somehow, they will never retain it). I'm sure it took a huge effort to get Chekhov to FA, though the article seems to have been given a bit of a break on quality requirements for some reason or other. 

One of my biggest problems is the eternally unfinished state of Wikipedia. Alexander Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, and 100s of other articles used to be GA or FA, but they were demoted because editing is left open after an article is promoted, allowing them to be destroyed by """"average"""" editors if there aren't vigilant babysitters watching. The other thing is that lovers of classic literature will usually find more info on their own out of a deep and abiding interest about writers and works than could ever be made available here. So who are we writing these literary articles for? A true reader will search things out like an Antiquary, and how many of those use Wikipedia as a reference? When it comes to writing articles on individual works, I favor reading the works themselves, rather than some trifle of an article, even if it's """"scholarly"""". I won't even start on the strange pseudo-government and society of Wikipedia, the invitation into which I must've misplaced. 

I used to read 5+ hours per day, and I miss it too much. I'm going to start on Waverly soon and the other volumes I have of Scott in Penguin and Oxford, with the preparation of watching the BBC history of Scotland with Neil Oliver. I'll take a look at this page and my """"old"""" talk page occasionally, so if you leave something for me I'll see it. (INeverCry) 71.94.14.136  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

Firstly, some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages...maybe you should read your own posts?  Also, the reason I decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what I had said.  Perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what I said but they did not apply to what I said and meant.  Perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what I mean and try not to take offense so easily.  I am respecting the basic rules of Wikipedia, but I also exploited """"loop holes"""" in the rules.  So if you want to include what I did in the rules then do so, but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning.  And I'm so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total assholes to me and to another person who tried to post this same page.  You asked that we do something, i.e. explain the significance of the clan, etc, and we did but you deleted it anyway.  And then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us.  Also, one of the pages I read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth...well what kind of bullshit is that?  If this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth?  Also, if I go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then I can site that and it becomes verifiable right?  If you say no, then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit.  Before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello Zhang17, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to Jesus is Lord Church has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk page.  Thank you.  -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Which picture?   Incidentally I'm writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

""""The footpath sign was a result of an abortive attempt to photograph the south portal of the Milford Tunnel - I did not think the golfers would take kindly to my walking across their fairways and I am not sure how else to get to it."""" When I went train spotting, I used to walk along the edge of the field at the opposite side off the Milford Road, opposite the signal box. The North Portal is said to be prettier and you seem to have caught it in a rare moment when it wasn't deep in shade. I like 058133 - the train gives it a bit of movement.

There are loads of photos around but they are all copyright. My solution is to link to  websites that are lkely to be permanent. """"Picture the Past"""" has a photo of Toadmoor Tunnel which really shows the elliptical shape.

058162 would show Ambergate station as it is now. Belper and Duffield have been similarly erased.

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

 Senior Editors' Observation needed 

I appeal attention of Senior editors from the globe to maintain the accountability of this page.

There have been many poor citations that are being used for cheap link building purposes and self-promotions.

Wiki user  is proven as doing vandalism here with inclusion of dead/non-existing & poor citations. He is including blogspot blogs also as references. 

 should know the following:

 Anyone can create a Blogspot blog and write this or that for years. If we start to give value to Blogspot blogs(that too not blogs of renown people) - then Wikipedia will be spammed by Blogspot blog links.
 No reference should be served as self promotion that is not relevant to Irom Charmila.
 What is """"Save Irom Sharmila Campaign""""? Where it is?? What they have done??? Do they have any valid citation of their instead of their own blog? If not then why they should be promoted?

Hence I appeal attention to prevent vandalism on this page.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,1

147912,43a4c5702d4f5f7b,"User:Scarfaced Charley 

I don't know if you remember Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations/Scarfaced Charley from over a year ago – I see he was also blocked as a Sockpuppet. I worked a bit on helping fix some of those.  Yesterday I found that Scarfaced Charley had made a duplicate Campaignbox template and therefore some relevant articles were using that Template:Campaignbox Little Rock while others were using the preexisting Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock which follows the WP:MILHIST convention of naming campaignboxes in accordance with the campaigns defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program unit of the National Park Service. That site is currently unavailable because of the Government Shutdown, but can be verified in Google's cache.

I merged the content into Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock, updated all the articles to use the correct campaignbox template, blanked the duplicate template and tagged it with db-t3. I had originally also put a redirect to the corrected template, but I couldn't figure out how to make both the redirect and the db-3 tag work... Hopefully I've done it correctly. Does this situation indeed qualify for speedy deletion or does it need to be brought to TfD? 

Also, there's one talkpage comment at Template talk:Campaignbox Little Rock. What's the proper way to handle that?  Thanks.",0,0,0,0,0,0

If his newspaper column was syndicated to 100 newspapers, as the person (Wildhartlivie) claimed, that's leaving out many cities and towns.  I checked all three of the newspapers that existed in Washington, DC at the time Karyn died, and none of them carried """"Kup's column.""""  People in DC couldn't watch his TV talk show, either.  It wasn't listed in the local TV guide.  If a """"celebrity"""" wasn't in Washington, DC in 1963, then he/she wasn't in a lot of places.  Same goes for Raleigh, North Carolina.  I checked the News & Observer in 1963.  No Kup's column.  Other good sources are people who were over the age of 18 living in DC and Raleigh in 1963.  I've talked with them, and they say they never heard of Irv Kupcinet until I told them about Karyn's death.

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither.

130625,bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

Whereas in the article on Messenius it states he """"accused Christina of serious misbehavior and being a Jezebel for which he was beheaded together with his 17 year old son.""""

In particular, phrases like """"Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals"""" (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

Speedy deletion of Outermesh
 A tag has been placed on Outermesh, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Courts: I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the 'foo law' sub-category for each US 'foo' state.  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. 

Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming 
importance at the state level, however, that it needs to be in multiple places or at the state level.

Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please respond in much more detailed and sensible argument and valid reasons to the two detailed replies to you, as to why you, with such hast and vigour, tagged for speedy deletion the article of the seven volumes of Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching The Watchers?). Please be kind enough to also provide your reply on your own talk page (This page, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NawlinWiki&action;=edit) and please also explain why, when I was editing the original article in the SandBox section, the drafts that I worked hard on, started, after a few hours of working on the page, to disappear every 12 seconds, and the Wikipedia Policy on top of the SandBox page states that the edits on the SandBox pages will be removed every 12 hours, not every 12 seconds. Then I go back to the Sandbox page to have another try, to create the article again, and there is a message typed by yourself, being the admin editor on duty at the time checking new edits and new articles being drafted, in the edit section, that """"the edits on this page will be removed every 12 seconds"""". The meaning behind this message was clear. No matter what I was to write in the SandBox edit page and/or in an actual article on a main Wikipedia page, you and those who you are fronting for have already decided to speadily delete the edit and/or article. The message is clear that the subject matter that involves the now destroyed the seven volumes of Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching The Watchers?), that are not for sale, as they simply do not exist anymore, but their original existence can be easily verified by speaking to the main political historian that was in charge of the ordering of the seven volumes of Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching The Watchers?) at the JS Battye Library, also by search in all the references and links that have been provided suporting the article, as well as reading the article on the Old Boys Melbourne High Schol page that has been on the internet for over 12 year, (Please See: Google search on Stephen Carew-Reid MHSOBA 1907-2009 : Luncheon Club - 8 July Stephen Carew-Reid - arguing with the Judiciary ...

-Stephen went to Christ Church Grammer School until 1962 when his family moved to Melbourne. There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers). The books have been named after his late Great Grand Father, Sir Edgar Bertram McKennal who was well known bronze sculpter in the earty 1900's in Melbourne who went on to becoming quite famous in Europe.

I have added a section on the law of Kamma. I prefer to call it Kamma (pali) instead of Karma ( sanskrit) as there is a negative meaning associated with Karma. Karma in the Hindu context means that ones deeds performed in previous lives are responsible for ones present conditions. This is a very pernicious Hindu doctrine and has been advanced by Hindu priests to escape from the social responsibility of alleaviting a man's condition. As per this doctrine all the poverty stricken, destitute people in this world must have been criminals in their previous lives. This cannot be true

The Buddhist law of kamma differs from the Hindu theory of Karma in this aspect. The buddhist law of kamma states that all actions are irreversable. That one cannot get rid of ones sins by asking for forgiveness or taking a bath in the holy river. An act once performed will leave its effect permanently on the society. It is the law of kamma that explains the maintainance of moral order in the world. It has nothing to do with the fortunes or misfortunes of people due to their actions in the previous birth.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

That strongly discourages me from engaging! And what is more when I do, I feel you've struggled to address any of these thoughts. Errant (chat!)

do you think you fairly represented the referenced material with this edit? I couldnt find in the BBC article the emphasis you put on  the material here at all. is that because I'm missing something or is it your POV editing? the article says everyone walked off in solidarity with the Xtians and as far as I could see didnt say  they stopped participating full stop at all

I think the issue of whether someone is extremely famous or not will invoke investigation of two issues. One is the issue of perspective and who makes the judgement call and the second issue is one of values and how we, as impartial observers, value different aspects of life in general. Third, and very likely the most important issue, is how society values them? Peale is currently in the Alumni section and I think it is only fair to keep it that way. It might be interesting to pose for discussion whether his contributions in the spiritual world are more important than other people's contributions in the worlds of science, politics, education and so on. This, without a doubt, will generate an unambigously political discussion and a very controversial one as well. If you are a deeply religious person, you might say that religion is very important. On the other hand, if you are a humanist, you very likely will disagree. Most people will opt for the middle ground on placing a judgement call.

Image hints...
Hello!

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

Pick an image name.
When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

Source the image.
On the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

Provide copyright and license information.
This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might """"create"""", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as """"only for use by Wikipedia"""", or """"for non-commercial use only"""", or """"for educational use"""".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

Describe the image.
To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.

Thanks for uploading Image:Andrew Ettingshausen.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link].

This is vandalism, simple. I reported the matter to the administrator notice board for vandalism. Yet all OwenX did was to remove my complaint, doing nothing to Ledenierhomme. “report elsewhere” means nothing and does not help.

No reason was given for its removal or why the need to be placed elsewhere. This is extremely unprofessional and rude.

Thanks for uploading Image:Toxic dvd.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Non-free content, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

I don't object to your content edit, but you blew away the citation referencing I did on the existing source. That's lazy editing. I spent a great number of hours formatting over 100 citations on that article so that it would have nice complete footnotes, and I don't appreciate having the sweat of my labor turned into an inline URL that might go dead in a month. Please take more care in the future. -  

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit. If you continue to undo the improvement of source citations that I am doing, the you and I are going to have a big problem. -",0,0,0,0,0,0

Since it has a significant section which takes up close to half of the article on events prior to 1920, it is logical to think that it is just more than the Azeri population of Armenia. Besides, the Turkic population of Armenia took much more time than in Azerbaijan to feel Azerbaijani, most still had ethnic feelings with the Turks of Turkey, particularly those in the region of Kars. It wasn't until Nakhichevan’s Turkic population’s self-identification that the Turkic people in Armenian followed.

Armenia has a history of Turkmen, Seljuk, Tartar and various other Turkic people who have lived there... I have difficulty understanding what point you are trying to make with this move.

Listen: there were 350,000 Germans in Vojvodina before the war, and about 250,000 of them left from the region together with the withdrawal German army, before partisans took control of the region. The remaining 100,000 were the subject for persecution. Also, it is not quite correct that those 250,000 fled the partisans, but they fled the Soviet Red Army. Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the """"Partisans"""" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article. However, the kind of compromise I would accept would be to write that most of the Germans colaborated with German troops during the war, and that this was a reason why partisans persecuted them.

Okay, I used to be a troll and a vandal.  I used to be large amounts of my time insulting and upsetting users and ruining articles for my own amusement. Recently, I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent, respectful contributor. I created an article called Adult Diapers in France. In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country.

Within minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.

Secondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.

Dispute over Human Rights Watch citation

This edit is the latest in a minor fracas over this cite, which fracas began here when Wehwalt removed the cite from the lede, describing HRW as a """"pressure group."""" Actually, in this controversial topic, probably the majority of sources could be described as """"pressure groups,"""" but that doesn't make them reliable when properly cited. I restored the cite in a less prominent position here, at which point Wehwalt added a rebuttal sentence, with edit summary """"added explanation of why the IDF knocked down these structures, consolidated into the Background section."""" I found this problematic, because the article doesn't actually say what Wehwalt added; it says that the group analyzed the claims by the IDF, and found them to be largely bogus. So, to leave Wehwalt's edit in place creates a false impression of what the HRW reports. I modified the section according, which edit was then reverted by Wehwalt. I'm going to leave it alone for a day or so to give Wehwalt the opportunity to clean it up. Incidentally, in Wehwalt's latest edit summary, he says that """"This is the article on Corrie, not on home demolitions. We are to give the reader a modicum of info on this, not draw conclusions."""" First of all, it seems to me that Corrie is only notable because of home demolitions. Secondly, giving the reader """"a modicum of info"""" would be best served by an accurate summary of the HRW cite, whereas altering it for POV reasons would be an example of """"drawing conclusions.""""

So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Oh hi. Long story short so I won't be """"ranting"""" (or what not) this time:

So Sjones is wikihounding me constantly for nearly a year now, and his pal Bridies is also obsessed with me to the point of where the great most of his entire activity here on Wikipedia in the 5 months was all about how to rid of me (while I've substantionally adited hundreds of different articles during the same period, over 5,000 in total since March 2012). That's just not normal. Btw, right now I'm blocked because I referred to this wikihounding by """"stalking"""" (which is just semantics really, apparently they call it """"cyberbullying"""" now outside the Wikipedia).

Now, GAs. Basically what The Devil's Advocate wrote in his comment - and this example of the so-called """"additional evidence"""" (as it was called by Sjones in his wikihounding thread) is indeed a good example of """"evidence"""", as it shows what is actually this """"problem"""" with me - and it's that I actually know (and obey) all the policies, rules and guidelines (including but not limited to everything regarding GAs and their reviewing process), while many reviewers don't know, and even when they're informed about the rules and guidelines (the proper ones, because in this case the reviewer was misinformed by some other apparently uninformed users, strangely including at least 1 admin) they might even flatly and completely refuse to acknowledge and use them (here, the reviewer's invoking """"ignore all rules"""" instead of admitting the wrong). I'm all for proper reviewing, instead of incorrect/arbitrary, which is why I've opened this thread recently (aftter this very debacle, precisely) because the scale of this problem (various types of bad reviewing) is pretty alarming, and some reviewers' blatant refusal to play by rules after they're being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable (that's my opinion, at least, but I can't see how could I be any wrong with being right).

 Videology page deletion 

Hi there. This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday. The reason given was because there was """"no explanation of significance."""" I was wondering if I could get more clarification.

According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article, an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant. It also states, """"The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible."""" In terms of credibility, it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch.

As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.

I'm very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter.

Thank you for your help, time and assistance.

I'll quote the relevant part for you:

Here's my best guess for who Slim Virgin's first account was:

I'll say why:

1) Created the Yvonne Fletcher article, just 1 minute after he had made his first edit to Pan Am Flight 103
2) Made many edits to Yvonne Fletcher article insisting that a marksman killed her, and pushing many conspiracy theories about it.  Encouraged links to Joe Vialls' sites on it.
3) Received a new user message on 14 December 2003, yet first edit wasn't until 17 January 2004, suggesting Darkaddress was in some trouble, and had edits wiped from history.
4) Basically stopped editing in July 2004.  Only made 2 edits since Slim Virgin started in November 2004.  These two edits were minor:  and , and were 6 months apart from each other.  This is suggesting that Darkaddress had a sock puppet.

Of course, this is all going with the theory that Slim Virgin is Joe Vialls.  It is just a theory.  It is at this stage a very thin theory, and I am hoping for some more meat towards it.  However, Joe Vialls is the only person I can think of who is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing and also is anti-Jews.  And, make no mistake, Joe Vialls is an expert on the Lockerbie Bombing.  He is also an expert on Yvonne Fletcher.  Indeed, he is an expert on Jews themselves.  He just happens to hate them, and blame them for everything.  Joe Vialls is also a former policeman turned detective turned journalist and conspiracy theorist.  Supposedly Joe Vialls died last year.  Joe Vialls is extremely secretive, and nobody really knows who he is.  He also likes to sign his name """"JoeVialls"""".  A bit like """"SlimVirgin"""" eh.

A little clutching at straws, I must admit, but it is at least a theory that fits.  Let's see if anyone can come up with a better one.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

'Bill' Blake, Actor, SPFX Makeup Artist, Special Effects Designer/Artist/Creator; mentored/trained by 1969 special Academy Award-recipient John Chambers (of original [1968] """"Planet of the Apes"""" fame), and best known for his work in, and doing studio promotions-for, the """"Planet of the Apes"""" Franchise (1968-1978), the feature-film version of """"Logan's Run"""" (1976-Beyond), and over 130 more. Resident of Phelan for nearly 20 years.

EITHER RESTORE MY REFERENCE IMMEDIATELY, OR REMOVE THE """"Forever Wild Exotic Animal Sanctuary"""" ONE, WHICH (BY YOUR 'DEFINITION') IS MORE LIKE PURE-PROMOTION, BEING THAT IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN OUTRIGHT LINK TO A PROMOTIONAL WEBSITE, MENTIONING THINGS SUCH AS ABC'S """"EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION"""" AND SIMILAR.

HOWEVER, WITH THE ABOVE HAVING BEEN SAID... PLEASE FURTHER NOTE:

Actually, I KNOW their noble-cause, and WOULD NOT want to see them removed, however, you cannot have it BOTH ways!

I have EVERY RIGHT to be recognized and mentioned for my considerable achievements (OVER 43 YEARS!) - ESPECIALLY WITHIN MY OWN COMMUNITY... and, elsewhere as well!!

102216,2300314038d87dad,"No Anome, what matters is the correct matching up of the maths to physical reality, and the polar coordinate system is the one that is tailor made to deal with concepts such as centrifugal force and Coriolis force.

The centrifugal force is a radial effect and the Coriolis force is a tangential effect.

But before we can use the expressions in polar coordinates we must construct a physical model of a real situation and then construct a differential equation around it, usually in the scalar variable of radial distance. 

If you were in the slightest genuine about this topic, you would have read the section which I added to the main article yesterday. You would have blocked PeR for vandalism and wikistalking for having erased it on specious grounds.

It hardly needed sourced since it is standard planetary orbital theory which obviously none of you know anything about. In fact I did mention Goldstein's Classical Mechanics.

The picture that I am getting here is that the article has been hi-jacked by a group who have had a basic introduction to circular motion but who would be incapable of handling elliptical or hyperbolic motion and so they will all make sure that no such generalizations appear in the main article.

Your group has indulged in a number of deceitful tactics which I will now list.

(1) Making arguments in polar coordinates but jumping into Cartesian coordinates to conceal the flaws. The main example is circular motion, which is all that you seem to be capable of considering. You accept one moment that there is a radially outward centrifugal force balancing a radially inward centripetal force. But as soon as the centrifugal force becomes inconvenient for you, you claim that it vanishes in the inertial frame, even though the centripetal force remains. That is just a nonsense.

(2) Trying to drag in the three body problem while totally sweeping the two body problem under the carpet. This is because you feel more comfortable in a field that nobody can understand. It is good cover for talking nonsense.

(3) Introducing Lagrangian mechanics.

(4) Introducing Hamiltonian mechanics.

(5) Introducing matrix algebra.

(6) Quoting Feynam.

We have seen all these tactics used in a pathetic attempt to deny the fact that centrifugal force only occurs when a particle actually possesses an angular velocity relative to a point.

The section which I put in yesterday contained partically all hat you need to know about centrifugal force. But that was too good for you. You much prefer that big mindless waffle of an introduction that tells us absolutely nothing about centrifugal force.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Evidence was produced by other users to show that he LIED when he said that he did just a simple copy-editing, as it was shown that he deleted sentences, and that he distorted the meaning of other phrases, simply because he has no clue about the Inclusive Democracy project.Despite all this, he comes back again and again adding/deleting and """"re-organizing"""" at will this entry.

I can agree with you on the religion part, but there are also a great many Spanish-speaking and African-American Christians, but I cannot ever recall a Lebanese marrying one of them, unless they were in Latin America of course.  Also, there are also non-Lebanese Arabic peoples who are not of a white appearance, but I still don't see them associating with these groups either.  James Zogby's site explains it all.  Just look at the list of 'famous arab-Americans.'  How come they are either mainly white looking or white's who do not identify, recognize or view themselves as Lebanese or Arabic?  It is more than clear what type of arab Zogby represents.  Now if his organization were called the """"White Arab-American Institute,"""" then I could go along with hime sense he would be truthful, but all arabs are clearly not represented.  It almost seems as if he wants America to view arabs as white and therefore only acknowledges white or whiter looking arabs. Maybe that is his hidden agenda.  This guy is a phony none the less.

(edit summary) Restore text cited to a reliable source

Just because the text is cited to a reliable source does not mean it merits inclusion. There is no encyclopedic value to citing how many Google hits a term gets, for a number of reasons. First, the source does not appear to give the exact way the phrase was entered, and thus the result is meaningless  it is very easy to manipulate Google results. Second, because the date is past and we cannot view the results, there is no telling how many of those hits were relevant to the topic and how many were not  the phrase is not so uncommon that it is unfeasible that many of them would not be relevant. Third, it is not really relevant  if the subject is notable in itself, then its presence on the Internet should be more or less a given and a Google test tells us nothing.

As I said, just because there is a citation for something doesn't mean there is a reason to include it. If there is a compelling reason why this information should actually be included, please produce it. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've worked in digital cash for about 20 years; it's clear that digital bearer token money (i.e. Chaumian blinded money) could be used to represent arbitrary assets.  There is a difference between distributed and centralized systems, and right now the only really viable distributed model is blockchain based, but the distinction shouldn't be """"cryptocurrency vs. non-cryptocurrency"""", but """"blockchain-based cryptocurrency vs. blinded token cryptocurrency"""".  They're both distinct from account-based money.

There are ways in which blinded money is actually *more* cryptocurrency than blockchain money  by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or account-based systems, blinded tokens are inherently fungible, which supports negotiability and finality.

Thanks. I'll contact you via your talk page. Henceforth, do not make further edits to this article unless you know exactly what you are doing. I've undone a couple of your edits as they impacted very negatively on readability. Unless you are intimately acquainted with the subject matter, please DISCUSS rather than MAKE possible edits. 

A case in point is your assertion re: a family of silk weavers being descendants of Sultan Sulaiman Shah. You've obviously not looked at the section I've headlined """"The Singora Legacy"""". This section links to the following reference:

You didn't read this, did you? 

Another issue concerns your edit as shown below:
  
""""The city was initially a Southeast-Asian political model vassal of Siam""""

Please, this is verbosity taken to the extreme. It's unreadable. It hinders rather than helps.

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch. WE call the shots. WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now?

 Inverted Ad Hominen is non-notable 

When I correct the ad hominem article later, I'm zapping the 'inverted ad hominem' term.  It is completely non-notable (86 hits in google) and was invented and inserted into the article by User:Layman.  Heck, the article itself even attributes it to Layman, a random web user, as having said it.

Original edit inserting it under an ip address
Edit by User:Layman the same day

There's a reason why the term wasn't invented by logicians too, because """"inverted ad hominem"""" is still ad hominem.  There's no """"inverse"""" about it.  The so-called """"inverse ad hominem"""" is just a case of ad hominem where someone says """"my qualifications are better than yours"""" instead of directly saying """"your qualifications suck.""""  The meaning is the same and there is no reason for another term.

The aramaena peoples are an extinct pseudo people who never existed since the Assyrians destroyed their kingdom and reduced it to a vassal state you mongrel. This Aramean Syriac name is a name created by radical separatists who deny their ethical heritage since the late 1980s you snake. The Assyrians speak modern Aramaic the Aramaic in which Christ spoke 2 thousand years ago you uneducated mule. Your statements lack depth in all facets; they are unencylcopediatic, unsourced, close minded, uneducated, mentally degenerate comments that seek to downsize the most ancient people down to nothing. You claim that this name was invented by some new comers almost a hundred years ago, this comment alone shows how completely incompetent you are. I have documents that are hundreds of years old that have been passed down through my family over the centuries that specifically speak about the Assyrians and how this name is far more ancient then simple minded people like you claim. This will be the only comment I will make for you because I will not waste my time speaking to a mentally degenerate pig such as yourself who is a denialist, racist, and complete bigot and a distorter of history who denies the race of the Assyrians exist.

 Re: Coca-Cola 

Sorry if I rudely didn't drop an explanatory note at your talk page; it was rude of me and poor behavior.

Please see our Manual of Style to understand the correct formatting and appearance standards. The one issue with your additions is that the captions for the images are entirely too long and full of extraneous information; image captions are not museum display cards and do not serve to detail every single item appearing in the image; Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a museum. They should also never state """"note the x"""" or other similar attention drawing text, per WP:W2W, one of our guidelines on writing prose. They also had inappropriate use of capitalization, boldface and other formatting issues. For example, ALLCAPS spelling is never used for emphasis, as it is read as shouting on the Internet. 

As for the Coca-Cola additions, I took them out for lack of relevance. The Coca-Cola article is about the drink, not the company; that's at The Coca-Cola Company. The information in those images is better placed there, but in the article text, not the image caption.

The other reversions were based on similar concerns; the same sort of formatting and caption length issues were present there. In the one article, for example, the caption was nearly as long as the rest of the text in the article, when that text should really go in the article's body text instead. 

Once again, my apologies for biting your head off, as you were editting in good faith. I hope that my poor behavior doesn't turn you off to the collabrative process and that, with a bit of polishing, you can add much to our growing base of knowledge.

2. Anonymous editor 216.79.140.195 says that three books, published respectively in 1629, 1878 and 1904, """"provide support"""" (weasel words!) for the idea that Jesus was crucified on a stake.  The form of the alleged support in not indicated.  Is that because they really only state that  and crux can, but do not have to, mean a simple stake.  That was known long before 1629, and also before 1930, when somebody claimed to have discovered it.  Even if the writers of the 1629, 1878 and 1904 books had stated that Jesus was crucified on a stake - which seems extremely unlikely - it is hard to imagine how they could possibly know better than the writer of the probably first-century Epistle of Barnabas, who described it as shaped like the letter T, and second-century Irenaeus, who described it as having """"five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails""""?

3. I could comment also on the gratuitous assertions in the paragraph, under the heading """"Pre-Christian use of the cross symbol"""", that the same editor added, starting with the authoritative-sounding """"It must be remembered that ...""""

72699,c27d6bc51ea4473b,"""The team was formed in 1977 by three ex-army motor cycle display team riders; Tony, Robin and Alan. Within a few weeks the team started building ramps and preparing motor cycles at Tony's workshop in Catford, S.E London.

New riders were trained for the first show which was at Mallory Park Race Track in Leicestershire. Early in 1978 preparations with George and Elstree Airport (North London) were made for Robin """"Smudger"""" Winter-Smith, to do a jump involving 31 Ford Escort vans. This along with a """"full team"""" stunt display took place on May 14th 1978. The jump was carried out successfully. Later that the team appeared on the ITV network's Saturday Banana Show, hosted by Bill Oddie, in which they performed stunts live on TV.

The team were then called upon to train Michael Crawford for an episode of his TV series """"Some Mothers' Do 'Ave 'Em."""" This episode was titled """"The Dispatch Ride,"""" Tony taught Michael some motor cycle tricks, in which Michael Performed very successfully. Tony also acted as a stunt coordinator while filming the show in 1978.

In 1980 team members worked on a film """"Silver Dream Racer."""" The star of this film was David Essex who was a very well known pop-star of this time. This year also saw two new members; John """"Golly"""" Goddard and Frank Welch, who were both training to jump with cars. 

In January 1982 the team along with """"Tina Roberts' Auto Angels"""" worked together, for """" Not The Nine O'Clock News """" which was a BBC TV programme. Both teams had a tremendous amount of fun whilst filming for the show. Tina now known as """"Firebird International"""" now travels and includes Pythons and singing with a band in her act. 
In May 1982 the team were performing in Brockley (South London). This was where John """"Golly"""" Goddard performed his first spectacular jump. He made a jump over 118 people laid down side by side. Later in the year on July 18th 1982 at the Chester Racecourse, John """"Golly"""" Goddard jumped successfully over 16 double decker buses , clearing a distance of 132ft. 

During the winter of 1982/3, Tony was busy working on a Kawasaki Z900 for a world record for """" 22 men on one motor cycle """". Once the bike was prepared the team and many friends went for the first practice. before the attempt was carried out many modifications were made. Once ready the team performed the event at the Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire. The attempt was successful and placed the team into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
John """"Golly"""" Goddard was also preparing his next big jump, this time over 15 trucks. This successful jump took place on June 12th 1983 at Trentham Gardens, Staffordshire. 

The team took part in the """"Game For A Laugh"""" show hosted by Jeremy Beedle (amongst others) where the team's stunts were shown. John """"Golly"""" Goddard also successfully rode through 25 Walls of Fire for this programme. 

In 1989 Tony met Nikki, Nikki and her son James (9 at the time), they both became actively involved with the team, Nikki acting as a commentator and James began riding motor cycles and learning tricks on his PW 80. Lizzette Daniel and Sue Rees were female members of the team. 

In 1990 the team gained 2 World records. Chris """"Spin"""" Simpson set a new World record for 25 walls of fire; also Lee French jumped over 300 shopping trolleys at the Sussex County Showground, Ardingly, setting another new world record. 

Team members """" Vertical Vince """" and Chris Simpson started forming slow wheelies, Vertical Vince is probably the country's top rider performing wheelies. 

From 1992 Tony started to prepare a Suzuki Jeep for 2 wheel driving. After practicing for several weeks it was ready to perform in early 1993. Also 6 other Suzuki Jeeps were prepared for the team, for formation driving. This made the team unique as it was the only team performing this type of show. The next Jeep to be built was the """" Wheelie Jeep """" in 1995. In 1996 the """" Endo Jeep """" was built and this was driven by Tony for a challenge in the ITV programme """" You Bet"""". 

In 1998 Tony received a call from an agent with an unusual request for a motor cycle rider to promote a film by 20th Century Fox called """"Waking Ned"""". What made the request unusual was that they required a rider to to ride around Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and Soho promoting the film,wearing nothing but a crash helmet and underpants . This was rather a chilly experience on a mid-September morning and this also received some very strange looks from people. 

Now the team performs 25-30 shows per year up and down the country. Tony and the team are busy with new ideas for the show. Brandon Bailey (Tony's son) just 9 years old already drives a Suzuki Jeep in the show, along with tricks on a motor cycle and a quad.

Unholy alliance
An unholy alliance is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups, especially if one is religious, for ad hoc or hidden gain. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the public interest. An early, well-known use of the term was by Theodore Roosevelt (TR):
TAB 
""""To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day."""" - 1912 Progressive Party Platform, attributed to TRO'Toole, Patricia, """"The War of 1912,"""" TIME in Partneship with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006. and quoted again in his autobiographyRoosevelt, Theodore. An Autobiography: XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, NEW YORK: MACMILLAN, 1913. where he connects Trusts and monopolies (sugar interests, Standard Oil, etc.) to Woodrow Wilson, Howard Taft, and consequently both major political parties.
TAB 
After the breakup of Standard Oil, TR lost the election, and the unholy alliance he had identified, oligopolies of a few big commodities corporations and their political allies, continued otherwise undeterred by the mutually beneficial indifference of both major political parties. In 1935, retired Marine Major General Smedley Butler described how this unholy alliance influenced U.S. foreign policy and how his job abroad had been to be a """"muscle man for big business."""" In 1944, conservative journalist John T. Flynn described how this unholy alliance uses religion to sell its agenda abroad to the American public:
TAB 
""""The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny, murder, rapine and barbarism. We are always moving forward with high mission, a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims while incidentally capturing their markets, to civilise savage and senile and paranoid peoples while blundering accidentally into their oil wells.""""Flynn, John T. (1944) As We Go Marching. p. 240
TAB 
A reference to this unholy alliance today is:
TAB 
Unholy Alliance, a review by PBS journalist, Rev. Dr. Allen Dwight Callahan of
TAB 
Phillips, Kevin (2006) American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century, Viking Press.

 Character bios 

It is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters' character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article. Also, it's not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I've seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|talk) 

I have just added the Zuka Club to the 'supporting characters' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I'm not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  

Well, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I'll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|talk) 

 Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  

I've added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the 'supporting characters' section. Do you guys think it's too much ...? And if not, could someone add the kanji and a picture?

I added her picture, but I don't know where to find the kanji for Kotoko.  (|talk) 

They should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there's a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can't read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that's what it says.

 Japanese Title 
While glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn't involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.

Now, I'm not all that fluent in the language, but I've seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I'm not aware of?  

I've since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga's titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn't normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  

I'll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) 

Yes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, 'bu' would be the",0,0,0,0,0,0

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff!

 Demographics (languages) 

I started a new section here out of not wanting to disrupt the non-related debate about another part of the demographics section.

Anyway, is it me or does the following passage not make sense? """"Over six million people in Canada list a non-official language as their mother tongue.[204] Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,012,065 first-language speakers), Italian (455,040), German (450,570), Punjabi (367,505) and Spanish (345,345).[205] and the languages most spoken at home by 68.3% and 22.3% of the population respectively""""

Surely the 68.3% speak an official first language as their native tongue, do they? The only other alternative I can think of is that that bit is meant to read 'languages most spoken at home by the...of the population which does not speak an offficial language as their mother tongue. That sounds cumbersome, of course, but if that is correct, there needs to be some clarification there. I asked on this page because as a non-Canadian I honestly cannot make sense of the wording. If I knew what it was trying to say, I'd have changed it myself.

Germany and Austria have very limited protection for freedom of expression.  France is much the same, except that penalties tend to be less extreme.  England also has quite limited protection.  In fact, the concept """"freedom of speech"""" is barely understood, let alone respected, in Western Europe, despite much pretentious posturing.  And before Americans get on a high horse about it, they should bear in mind that a high level of legal protection was only reached in 1964, in a Supreme Court decision in a case involving Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

There are many illusions about these topics.

Until this edit yesterday, which smuggled in some changes under a misleading edit summary, the map/diagram simply used standard three-letter abbreviations for all the countries included, generating the common name of the country (including China and Taiwan), a link to the relevant country page and a flag icon. That was internally consistent in terms of format, clear and in line with our article names. The bid to change that - and introduce different formats with separate flag icons and name-links for China and Taiwan and also full-form names for the two of them - was, reasonably enough (and entirely correctly in my view), reverted. Rather than their trying to justify the change brefore reintroducing it, we then had various people edit warring the change, or variations of it, back in, often using bizarre edit summaries referring to Israel, WP not being ISO etc. I will restore the stable, prior, internally consistent version (I see it's just been changed yet again) and then perhaps can those obsessed with changing such a minor, trivial point put their case here first, before messing with it again?

Basically: because someone put the steam measurements in doubt, Francesco Celani asked directly to the measurer, i.e. chemist dr Gilberto Galantini, if the measurement regarding steam were made with the appropriate devices, how was the steam, etc.
Galantini answered to Celani, and Celani published the statement made by Galantini i.e. the steam measurer.
Therefore there is no doubt at all from Francesco Celani about the sutability and satisfatoriness of the measurements.

Hi!  Just a couple of pointers.  I see you're trying to upload an image of the skyline, which I think is a great idea.  First I'd recommend you use the Sandbox to test out how your edits will look, as adding images to Wikipedia isn't always the most intuitive thing you can do.  Also, I don't think it's recommended to link to images external to Wikipedia.  If you are trying to upload an image you own, or that you can verify is free of copyright, use the Upload file function, then link to the image once it's on the wiki servers.  Hope that helps.

We're going to have problems with some editors, because it seems they have no practical experience with what real chemists, in real usage, call a chemical synthesis. This corruption of use, which started in the chemical synthesis article, seems to be migrating to this article as well, and it will be stopped ). The next point is that this article should not be ended with a brainless enumeration of kinds of chemical reactions, but it could be well served by a series of links to Wikipedia articles on types of chemical reactions, articles which already exist within the Wikipedia. For example there already are articles on hydrolysis and one on the hydration reaction.

While we all offer edits which tend to improve the article, you need to exercise better caution in your edit summaries.

In other words, knock off the bullshit sarcasm, or you won't like the ensuing discussion. - Jack Sebastian (talk)

Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. Wikipedia appreciates your help. We noticed though that when you edited Littleton, Colorado, you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page Glee (check to confirm | fix with Dab solver).

Perhaps if both questions had been asked in the same survey: """"do you understand the scientific method?"""" and """"do you believe in ESP?""""; and the results had shown a significantly greater level of ignorance of the scientific method amongst ESP believers than others, then your conclusion might be valid. As it is, you have two different surveys about two different things and you cannot simply join up the results to show what you want to show. Consider if a third survey had shown that 99% of the population believes the world is round; could you then conclude that the vast majority of those that believe the world is round only do so because they do not understand the scientific method?

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

The problem we are facing is the problem with pretty much any wikipedia discussion, it's way to freakin long. There is a reason commercials are only 60 seconds max, and that TV shows don't go on for 20 hours. Everyone has a limit as to how much time, concentration, and otherwise engery they can devote to reading random rantings posted by people they don't know on a project that they have no direct impact to that they edit for some nebulus reason of trying to make the world's largest free encyclopedia.

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa. So I honestly believe that you're about 180 degrees on this one - your statement, while eloquent, was somewhat meaningless, whereas History makes some valid points (the most valid of which is that if you (speaking in the generic, non-threatening second person) call me a """"southerner"""", I will tie you to the back of a pickup truck and drag you to your death while throwing beer cans out the window to hit you in your skull.

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it. I'm getting tired of having that same accusation thrown at me all the time and I take it as",0,0,1,0,0,0

RDH, I wouldnt be so proud to label youself a """"Wiki Facsist"""", as you have no idea of what the original meaning is of that world. That particular philiosophy caused millions of people to DIE, and people who disagreed with them were put to death. Please read the Wiki entry on Facsists. 

And, how do you know that the orignal entry on a page (with no corrobarting backup) is """"factual information"""". You adjust your meaning of """"factual information"""" to fit your particular brand of socialist bullshit. Just because Leithp is less of a """"Wiki Facsist"""" is not a glowing statement either. The Wikipedia concept is doomed to failure becuase we have so-called editors like yourself who edit the pages to satisfy yourselves. A real editor has knowldege of a particular subject matter, and is supervised by people to ensure fairness of content. The REQUIRED registration solves no problem except less work for people like you, but still leaves an enormous creditability problem, which WIKI has been recently exposed to have.

 I understand your point. I will have to agree with you on renaming as well. From what I understand, it would be similar to what Current main Luftwaffe article has. A sub section representing Combat history in WWII. One might even add the other article of Organization of Luftwaffe in WWII as another section. 

   So How are we to go about getting this done ? As it is, all 3 articles have sufficient referenced information on their own. All we need is to put it together in a coherent fashion.

Involvement of William Colby

As someone who's reluctantly studied this case for many years (and is always looking for good reason to dimiss it and thereby sleep better at night), the one splinter that remains in my side when I try to explain away the reality of it all is the apparent endorsement of this entire allegation by former CIA director William Colby. Since Colby is mentioned numerous times in DeCamp's book, and appears directly in the Conspiracy of Silence documentary, it seems safe to say that he agrees with this.

How much stronger does testimony get? The guy was the former director of the CIA for god's sake. Add to this the fact that he was very likely murdered when you review the details of his death, and it seems likely that this guy was considered a threat to SOMEONE. Whether he was killed because of this particular case remains to be proven, but it's all far too suggestive for me. If it were just DeCamp ranting and raving about a massive ring of sadistic pedophiles within the government, I'd find it all much less convincing. But Colby's apparent agreement with his thesis is quite chilling to me.

I don't necessarily think this should change its """"hoax"""" status within Wikipedia, but I'm curious what the true skeptics (a camp I'd like to be able to join), think about this particular detail. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level.

So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".

You leave me condescending messages in which you refer to me as """"son"""" and accuse my accurate information of being """"vandalism"""".

Relativism Contradicts itself 

To propose the statement, """"truth is relative,"""" it condraticts itself as identifying that statement as an absolute truth.  """"Truth is relative,"""" is not a relative statement.  It is absolute.  Thus the whole Sophist philosophy is proven incorrect.  Relative truths, however, can exist, but the idea that reality can be percieved in a truth to however a person feels it is, is simple ridiculous.

Personally, I cannot make any sense of the previous paragraph, which just goes to show that individual reality (and therefore truth) is probably relative after all.  In my reality, the truth is that there are rules of grammar and spelling that should be followed if you want people to understand what you are talking about.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

After the article published on Le Monde newspaper , it's been recalled on the French talk page that hiding specific dimensions of a topic is considered WP:POV . The current montage doesn't even show the actual city, only a collection of lifeless landmarks close-ups. For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis.

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0,0,0,0,0,0

There is no good hand / bad hand here, that's a total misuse of that concept, another attempt to smear me with no grounds whatsoever. This is not an """"alternate persona"""", this is me talking the way I talk, trying to resolve an issue with another user the way I would do normally, a user I have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing. In this case however, for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins, I just don't happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because I happened to have decided to try and do that.

But I'll take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of WP:SOCK I have actually violated, or indeed identify which part of WP:HARASS I am supposedly guilty of, as evidence that you can't. Not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that Malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation, or had asked me to leave and I had refused to do so. I guess you two can live with that I suppose, but mark my words, if or when there's an arbitration case concerning Malleus' conduct, then I'll be entering this experience into evidence, and adding User:ErrantX and User:Bwilkins as admin parties to it, with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user, who neither requested the communication to stop, or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way. I did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if Malleus was willing, given that there's some simple concluding statements that arise from it that I'd have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not, but I get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason, whether he was interested in doing so or not. I sincerely hope there's nothing deeper than simple admin over-reaching going on here, but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes. I'm sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like AGF, indeed the steps outlined in policy.

Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also """"the"""" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German """"von"""" or """"zu"""" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph's title as Fürst, which wouldn't make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that Kintetsubuffalo/Chris has a good point when he says that the article """"reads more like a family genealogy"""", but I don't think that the solution is to trim out the less notable people.   On the contrary, they have a place in the story of the family, but the significance of their role intends up being uninentionally overstated by the article's structure.
The genealogy is clearly an important part of the article, but I suggest that it should be at the bottom of the article, in the place where an appendix would be in a book. What the article needs, I suggest, is a clear narrative,  telling of the story of the family's activities. That could be done either thematically (e.g. politics, medicine, industry) or chronologically, or maybe by a combination of both approaches.
Vernon has clearly done a lot of excellent research, and has plenty of useful material with which to tell the story here, and I would really enjoy reading the story once it's written up.  I have been looking for a few articles which might serve as examples of how this might be done, and found a few which might help:
Rothschild banking family of England (the best I found)
Bulmer (family) (a much weaker article but it tells a story)
Mitford family (narrative a bit short, but heading in the right direction)
German sisters (more integrated than the Mitfords)
Smalbroke family (chronologially ordered, and somewhat genealogical in focus, but does tell a story)
Hope this helps. But in the meantime I have removed the notability tag, because notability doesn't actually seem to be in question.  (talk) • (contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Language and Writing section cleanup 

This section's three subheadings all have minor to major issues.
The first sentence under Literature and Mythology, e.g., is an incomprehensible run-on, and the final sentence under Philosophy just cuts off mid-line. Some tone and word-choice issues persist elsewhere in the section.
Busy writing a paper about this stuff at the moment or I'd fix it myself.
Does anyone at least have time to fix the serious issues with readability?
  

 Did a school paper get added to this article? 

I'm not much of a wiki expert, but about halfway through the last entry (on Ziggurats) the style of the article changed to sound like a middle-school paper on the topic, with no references.

Hello, Kuno Klamm, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one of your contributions does not conform to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View policy (NPOV).

There's a page about the NPOV policy that has tips on how to effectively write about disparate points of view without compromising the NPOV status of the article as a whole. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have!

 Just a heads up 

I thought you might like to know that the Awards Center page has been deleted, along with its newsletter.  (

So, where do we go from here?

To new and even more interesting projects, of course!

As announced in the newsletter, I've been preparing to co-coordinate a large collaboration/competition called Around the World.  It was going to be run at the Awards Center, but since that no longer exists, the collaboration will be hosted somewhere else.

Around the World will begin July 15th as planned - it's location will be announced soon.  

It'll be a blast.  In the competition, participants will be helping to develop over 200 pages (drafts, which will be moved to article space once they are ready), using advanced tools to edit every single one of them!

This is going to be interesting.

And the event shall have awards which are being created specifically for it as we speak!

If you would like me to keep you informed of this and other interesting collaborations I'll be working on and/or organizing in the future, please drop me a note on my talk page, and I'll be happy to keep you in the know.

I look forward to your reply.

Here's a good look at the next-generation Toyota Prius. The inside word from Japan is that the '09 version of the landmark hybrid will deliver both better fuel economy and more power. Engine size increases to 1.8 liters. New batteries and refinements to the Hybrid Synergy drive — maybe even a solar panel on the roof and eventually plug-in capability — could up city economy to 80 mpg. It may not look it, but the body will be all-new, growing 1 in. wider, but getting 1 in. shorter in overall length.

And to the extent that Wikiepdia influences these people's opinions and the way in which they vote in the political sphere, which again is what LS is discussing (as opposed to the science), then yes WMCs contributions for his side of the debate as well as his maligning of his opponents in their BLPs (as LS alleges) clearly could have a significant impact.  Your mileage may vary on the assumed impact of Wikipedia in this context.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 So you think that something like feline animalism is an assertion? I don't think I'm making myself clear at all then / Your page says you have a BA in Philosophy - are you familiar with much philosophy of language? Perhaps you'll like seeing a more formal argument:
 Assertions are statements: things that can be true or false (cf """"is it raining?"""", which is a question not a statement)
 A common, sensible, and relevant use of ID is """"we came about through intelligent design, not evolution""""
 That makes no sense if ID is a statement, so ID can't be a statement (cf """"we came about through one phenomenon, not the other"""")
 If ID isn't a statement, then it can't be an assertion (QED)
Where do I go wrong? ((Compare ID to lamps, Marxism, and Goldbach's conjecture: """"I assert [that] lamps"""" makes no sense, because """"lamps"""" can't be true or false. """"Marxism"""" also can't be true or false. But """"every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes"""" can be. The reason the lead sounds right is because that is the thing that supporters of ID often assert.)) T """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Iraq's process, from research only, was also substantially different. So, either the administration DID find WMD's in Iraq and chose to instead embarrass the nation by denying them AND cover up an Iraqi WMD attack upon the US, which would be a clear cut act of war or the conspiracy theory is wrong. The """"makes sense"""" part then yields to Occam's razor, the conspiracy theory would have to be that the US choose to loose standing and face international criticism over invading Iraq and finding no WMD's AND pass up the opportunity to declare war on Iraq for a WMD attack OR the anthrax was NOT weaponized by Iraq, as it was coated and prepared differently than the Iraqi anthrax weaponization program did, but prepared in a way researched and used in past US programs. In short, the conspiracy theory fails on any examination of the facts as known.

My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments. I think I disagree with both Ikip and Ludwigs2 more often than I agree, but they in particular have made good comments.

 HJM - I would be happy to see you (or anyone) open a neutrally worded mediation discussion with the aim of reducing the adversarial atmosphere, but the venue needs to be appropriate to the issues. Several editors there have expressed concerns with the MedCab process, so Wikipedia:WikiProject Environment (perhaps after creating a dedicated taskforce) would seem a good place to discuss organization of the whole family of articles, and RfC/U or ArbCom would be good for discussing editor conduct. There have already been a number of RS/N, NPOV/N, and BLP/N discussions of related issues that could probably be exhumed for background. I have some hope, though, that the recent infusion of fresh blood might work out a solution without escalation.

 That said, I would not close the discussion you propose - the strength of the collaborative editing model lies in seeking and acting on consensus rather than acceding to the rationations and whims of any single editor. - 2/0 (cont.)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Currently, the Kachin Independence Organization is supporting the Burmese regime's sham National Convention.

In public, the KIO is hoping to participate in future election after constitution has completed that guaranteed Burmese military regime 25% of reserved seats in central puppet government, according to Gauri Zau Seng, vice-Chairman of KIO/KIA.

Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

Would it make sense, then, to include a line in the article that says:

Would that keep you happy, michaelm?  That seems to be a pretty fair depiction of the situtation here. The trouble is that this is not the Wikipedia style. The Wikipedia style is to report facts. Where a contentious matter is at debate, sometimes articles will use words like, """"Some people believe that...."""" this is officially discouraged.

I have no concerns about his edit, but it is unsourced. I trust this guy, but we may have to wait until his Encyclopedia about Galliformes comes out and totally revises the taxonomy. Pinudjem is his second part of his middle name (Amoun-Pinudjem) of his alternate name (Milad Sourial). If you search for that name on the web you can see that he is making a movie called """"Goddess of the Sun"""", not only from the photo gallery concerning the Green Peafowl but also from a site not by him.

Kermit does not have a real name. His real parents gave him a name he didn't like. Sadly, his real parents died in a political assacination. He was then named Kermit Roosevelt by his adoptive parents, but he didn't like that either. He has three user accounts: User:Amoun-Pinudgem (middle name), User:Milad A.P. Sourial, and his newest is User:Pinudjem. However, he has also edited with an IP once, which was reverted. He often writes under Kermit Blackwood and was also quoted in the Red Data Book as K. B. Woods (who suggested that Greens are monogamous and possible Yunnan subspecies).

He is a writer on the Feathersite, a site that talks about poultry, wild ducks and gamebirds, etc.

One must know that Kermit is not sure that the Green Peafowl is a superspecies complex, but that he created that hypothesis, and that he believes the best way to know the truth is to try and disprove it. However, preliminary data confirms his hypothesis of multiple species. He has already collected tissue samples and compared them but he believes it is better if nuclear DNA can also be extracted from samples.

Wolfgang Mennig, a breeder who suggests that there are additional subspecies (not species), also confirms (he e-mailed me) that he is friends with Kermit and that they try to work together as much as possible.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You only want it to say """"x claims that it is part of the uncodified constitution"""" because you disagree with the claim and want to lessen its authority. Have you actually found a source yet which would say its not part of the uncodified constitution? I would have thought that almost everyone who accepts the existence of an uncodified constitution would accept Magna Carta is part of it. I therefore don't see the need to attribute it to one source only, especially as I don't think it's particularly controversial to say that Magna Carta is part of the uncodified constitution.

==Seating plans==
The predominant floor plans are comprised of vis-a-vis resp. face to face seats, seating rows resp. face to back with split orientation (half in each direction) for trains operated in both directions and a combination of those principles. In regional transport we can find seats aligned with the tracks to give more room to the standing passengers. In scenic trains seats are beeing orientied some degrees to the window are used. Some design variants have curved banks of seats to form a lounge. Flip flop seats that can be changed from face to face to face to back orientation are not used much due to its weights and consequences of the additional mechanism.

While this information could still be valuable, I don't think it's worded very well here.  Besides, the seating arrangements are different for each car type, and this text deals more with coaches than other types.  It seems to me that seating arrangements are better described on the car type pages themselves and not here.   20:48, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Inspection of the 6 files suggest that great many entries will be irrelevant for a student of literature just a great deal would be irrelevant for a student of engineering, so optimization can be considered.  I may look at MongoDB first.

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""". I personally try to avoid expressions such as """"None of the increase"""" and would be inclined to write """"No part of the increase""""... """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well I checked you out, and you should be happy to know, I really don't take account age into consideration.  I'd be willing to take you on as a coachee, but there are 2 criteria.  1. You go up for RfA when I tell you your ready. 2. You disclose to me on or off wiki any other accounts you've had (I don't think you have, but I just feel the need for that rule.)  If you agree, your first lesson is to update the Admin coaching status page to reflect this.  Your second is to create a usersubpage User:Steve Crossin/AC and watchlist it.  I'll give you lessons there an what not.  Assuming everything works well, I'd say a late May, early June RfA would not be out of the question. ' talk

24 character article
Ok, so I did a quick format of the article, and started searching online for interviews with the actress. I have come up dry thus far, and was wondering if you have found anything.   

Specifically what article were you referring to? And, an admin has said I can use material from the 24 magazine.    

I was looking for those interviews, but I couldn't find them. I was trying to help with the Karen Hayes article.   

Ahh, the article on Miss Hayes P Hehe, I have a fair bit of info on her, and I can also now abuse the use of {{cite episode}}. A citation is a citation. Also, I know it hardly ever happens with TV shows, but what rating do you think the Nadia Yassir article would receive? That is, after the injunction is lifted.   

Definitely B, lots of references but needs to be more expansive for GA status and beyond. Once you gear up to do that, you could always post the references for Hayes that you find on her talk page, that way I could help out )   

Hehe, I could do that..and I think I will also work on trying to get Nadia Yassir to GA status. But my real goal? Getting Jack Bauer to featured article status. It would look quite good on an RFA. I'm gettng admin coaching. And also, I prefer bullets, so don't mind if I realign your comments on my talk page P

 More useful info 
A voice chat session was conducted soon after the episode 7 release, during which the pure pwnage crew answered questions from fans around the globe. There was quite a bit of interesting info to gain from listening to recordings of the chat session. Some of this info should probably be worked into the article here. One such recording is currently at http://chigau.com/ppchat-edited.mp3 Another artifact related to the show would be Anastasia's blog. However, I cannot ascertain the true nature of this blog (whether it's Anastasia's 'real' blog, or just a prop set up for the show). Despite the fact that it is claimed to be the real blog, during the chat session mentioned above, I find it hard to believe the claim, due to the language used throughout the blog itself.
 July 5, 2005 12:27 (UTC)
 You can bet your life it's not real ;-) 
 The fact that the blog mentions Jeremy being put in the hospital for playing WoW is an obvious give away that the blog is purely fictional.  02:07, August 20, 2005 (UTC)
 Don't be so sure. That's how I felt until I started looking around a bit more. Listen to the chat, read the blog, browse some of their forums. Now I'm not so sure. Considering that the blog starts before the sixth episode it seems pretty real and the way they keep mentioning on the forums that when they have PP meets people can't belive how close to the truth the show is. 
 It's fiction, partly based on real life. Come on, if you think PP is really happening watch the 9th episode.
-someonelse: well actually, i agree with aupajo. I'm not saying that people can shoot micro, or that  dave used to be some kind of micro warrior, but its possible that the crew used to act like they do in the first couple episodes, and changed their ways.

 Reviews of Pure Pwnage 

 by Anonymous (67.140.145.26) Essentially Jeremy embodies the very scum of online gaming in a package that is all too familiar.  Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word """"n00b"""") that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.  I can only hope that this scathing satire of that type of behavior will help show new gamers how NOT to act.

and what, may i ask, does this pov have to do with wikipedia? 

Not much, if not anything. This review was moved here after a Wikipedian noticed it in the main article and decided not to just scrap the whole thing.

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0,0,0,0,0,0

I now think almost no tetrachromats conversationally distinguish the fourth range, but instead almost all have, since babyhood, been perceiving colors as trichromats do, because they're trained that way using pictures and what grownups persistently say. Conversational tetrachromacy being rare is probably supported by the absence of any support from almost any business, especially businesses with customers who are almost all women and which depend on color perception for customer satisfaction, since most would be happy to expand their sales by 2% by carrying products for tetrachromats and staffing with a tetrachromat and advertising it, but they don't, so the incidence of conversational tetrachromacy among adults and adolescents is likely extremely rare.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Cgriffioen!

I have put together a survey for female editors of Wikipedia (and related projects) in order to explore, in greater detail, women's experiences and roles within the Wikimedia movement. It'd be wonderful if you could participate!

It's an independent survey, done by me, as a fellow volunteer Wikimedian. It is not being done on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation. I hope you'll participate!

Just click this link to participate in this survey, via Google!

Any questions or concerns, feel free to email me or stop by my user talk page. Also, feel free to share this any other female Wikimedians you may know. It is in English, but any language Wikimedia participants are encouraged to participate.

As of 70 minutes ago, Sturgeon bay fire dept responded to the holiday motel right at the east end of the downtown bridge.

Get this, they have 2 pumpers, 1 mini pumper, 1 tanker, 1 ladder truck, and 1 rescue truck from the city.... AS WELL AS 1 pumper, 1 mini pumper, and 1 rescue from the southern door fire dept...... And they have only started (as of this writing) to try and put it out!!!!! Even then, there are only 3 people actively fighting the fire - the rest are just standing around WATCHING!!!

If this is true, we should keep in mind that this info should ultimately be on the page for this topic.  The trick is supporting that it's true, of course.  I looked at your source for the ballot, and it's unclear to me how recent the information on that page is (I couldn't find a date of publication for the info, and my half-knowledge of Spanish may be insufficient to help me know whether this is or is not the current government's ballot for the upcoming elections (as opposed to the ballot as it had existed previously, before the crisis).  But if it is the current government's version of the ballot, that's interesting, especially since it seems like César Ham in particular should be disqualified by Article 239 just as it was argued Zelaya was.  (Possibly Reyes as well, but definitely Ham given that he participated in the """"reclaiming of the ballots"""" thing.)  That's an inconsistency in the argument of the Micheletti side.

I note that this is a Honduran source, which may not be admissible under the current """"Honduran newspapers are likely to be mouthpieces for the establishment, so they're not reliable sources"""" view which has been prevailing here, but it's unlikely a pro-Micheletti source, on the other hand, would lie about what Micheletti's formal position is.  We could probably trust it to print what Micheletti says will be on the ballot.  I'm more concerned that I'm not sure the source you've posted here has a date indicating that it is the current version of the ballot.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

78302,d18b97a23b823be0,"""I am removing the following section for two reasons:

""""Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.""""

1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):

""""Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later
adulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and
that similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa,
Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001).""""

Here are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:

McCrae, R. R., & Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.

McCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.

Costa, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &McCrae;, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.

As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's """"likely true of most subordinated individuals"""" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)

2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research """"reinforces stereotypes"""" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.

Hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.

 22:26, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word """"discovered"""", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with """"While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention.""""

It is not that I am seeking a re-review as such, but rather seeking more specific instructions on how I could change the article to have it submitted successfully. In terms of the notability of the subject, the newspaper articles I have referenced talk about his popularity in Australia where he was a regular on television and popular. I'm happy for the page to be edited if anyone has better sources than me. I think that part of the issue is that his peak in popularity was during a period where the internet barely existed. It probably also doesn't help that he's Australian and therefore not as well known as he may be if he was on American television. He would regularly sell out 2,000-3,000 seat venues during his peak.

Its is common knowledge in South India as to who the Sengunthar/ Kaikolar are and its not my problem if you've been living in a very close knit community or unaware of this.

1. The following is quoted from a legitimate third party website. http://globalindiamissions.org/newsletter/nwsltr0802.htm

The Kaikolan are a large Tamil and Telugu caste of weavers. There are seventy-two subdivisions (nadu or desams). Their name comes from a mythical hero and from the words """"kai"""" (hand) and """"koi"""" (shuttle). They consider the different parts of the loom to represent various gods and sages. They are also known as Sengundar, which means a red dagger, which is traced to the legend of the earth being harassed by demons, which led to the people asking the god Shiva to help them.

Traditionally, one girl in every family was set apart to be dedicated to temple service and becomes a """"Devdasi"""" (meaning female servant of god). In the temple, the girl is considered married to the temple deity but in practice becomes a prostitute, especially to the Brahmans and she learns traditional music and dancing.

2. This is taken from a journal research article with abundant valid references. This is as legitimate as it gets.

This article talks in much detail about how women from the Sengundhar/ Kaikola caste get into the sacred prostitution in temples.

""""Contending identities: Sacred prostitution and reform in colonial South India Priyadarshini Vijaisri A1, A1 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi"""" South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group Issue: Volume 28, Number 3 / December 2005 Pages: 387 - 411

To view the complete article just register, its free.

Here are the links 

http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/link.asp?id=jv31l27518262711 If you cannot access it then just go to the following page and follow one of the links

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q;=Contending+identities%3A+Sacred+prostitution+and+reform+in+colonial+South+India

3. This is taken from another legitimate webiste http://www.go2southasia.org/l_peoples.html of a world renknown organisation recognised by many countries. They have no gain in just picking on the Sengunthar caste.

The KAIKOLAR people are a caste of weavers 1.5 million strong in southern India. They are Hindus and view different parts of the loom as representations of various gods and sages. Traditionally, each Kaikolar family sets aside one daughter to serve in a Hindu temple. That daughter is considered married to the temple deity—often the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. In practice, the daughter becomes a temple prostitute.

All 3 of the above references are quite legitimate and I can quote many more. There is no question of coincidence or any error in any of these sources.

 Swastika as a mnemonic device http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html 

The article needs more information about the swastika's use as a modern mnemonic device. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Rex Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by the National Socialist German workers Party as alphabetic symbolism, including meshed """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism."""" The leader of German National Socialists at that time altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  Professor Curry showed that many modern myths use a false belief that Nazis called themselves """"Nazis.""""  The myths cause widespread ignorance of the eytmology of the word """"Nazi."""" Party members called themselves """"National Socialists,"""" not """"Nazis.""""  Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas use the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not call their symbol a """"swastika.""""  Another person conceded the point with the comment that """"It does seem to be the case that the National Socialist German Workers' Party originated the 45° orientation...."""" though they did not necessarily originate that use, the German National Socialists did independently alter their use of the symbol for their specific desire to highlight the """"S"""" letter for """"socialism."""" Of course, the additional comment that they didn't use the 45 degree orientation consistently also concedes Professor Curry's work showing that their leader deliberately altered / evolved the symbol from its historic orientation into meshed """"S"""" letters for socialism. The graphic resonance is highly suggestive... and in fact it is compelling! In fact, one of the flags that Dr. Curry cites argues for that thesis: The swastika itself comprises two S's, and that is shown to have been known consciously when the German National Socialists overlay two additional S's for another group (as German National Socialists had other examples of similar alphabetic symbolism). Hitler even altered his own signature to reflect the same """"S"""" for socialism and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html The leader of the German Socialists had no reason to harp on this idea because he was an ex-artist. Nevertheless, he did allude to the alphabetic symbolism in his own comments in his notorious book. Of course, he would not drone on about it just as he did not drone on about what the stylized """"SA"""" symbol meant, or the side-by-side """"SS"""" symbol, or the """"VW"""" (all of which other writers concede for some inconsistent reason). The only reason it is so hard for most people to understand today is because they have been trained to use the hackneyed shorthand for the Party and most people are ignorant of the name of the actual Party, and thus have no idea that the Party actually espoused a dogma that they called """"Socialism."""" Even to this day, people repeatedly delete Dr. Curry's work in an effort to perpetuate the ignorance and the myths.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The reason this pro-russian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other pro-russian admins are allowing this. Also, your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesn't help either.

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",0,0,0,0,0,0

That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype. Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someone's ignorance and stupidity.

Do you experience urges to rip out the cards of the books that you simply do not like? I can assure you that you need to try and suppress those urges. OF COURSE I added those ISBN's for you dear.

Keep in mind that I've been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway off-Wikipedia before I was blocked.

It's refreshing to see some true civility for a change.  Especially after having had four different admins block me (actually, it's probably more than the last four), without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so.  Then there's the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard, but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smoke-filled back room.

Duk and Haukur were decent, and know more about what they're talking about because we've been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past; even I've locked horns with both of them at various times, we've managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings (can't say that for everyone else involved).

Mostly, however, what I've much of anything not even remotely resembling civility, in this entire process.  At least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized, magic-incantation, Wikipedia-jargon meaning of that term.  It's no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it; it has nothing whatsoever to do with real-world concepts of civility as they use it.

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"no original research"""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"warts and all"""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - 

""""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective. 

 Bauer 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   
 I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. 

""""or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""""

I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won't make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It's the Internet equivalent of stoning. 

This is not a fabrication. I get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or """"group troll,"""" or a """"self-interested partisan,"""" or a """"blog comment commando,"""" or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself. You also made a """"theoretical"""" comment about me being """"nosy, fat and ugly."""" Putting the word """"if"""" in front of it doesn't make it any less of an insult. I've tried to be polite to you, and will continue to do so, but this is the response.

WRONG retard, The good ending is not the canon ending. Wheeler only said that no one knows what happened to Cybil.

They don't take kindly to people that don't share their beliefs. And they are known to have the ability to track people down.

 Dumb question? 

Would the repeal of withholding, via Constitutional amendment, apply only to Fed income taxes?  That is to say, would the States be bound to repeal withholding as well, since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place?

I may have missed it inside the article (which is very good indeed) and if I did I apologize, but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact, a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer.  Simply put, a dollar represents a unit of freedom.  And if the phrase """"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"""" has any truth to it at all, it means political power is being leveraged, indeed heavily back to the consumer/producer for every dollar he keeps.

 polyandry in Tibet 

Hi there. On 30 September 2005 you made a number of significant additions to this article, which have survived to this day, or would have, save for my undoing them:
Marcus S. Goldstein, whom you introduced to the text by explicit wiwilink as quoted here, as well as further described with his birth and death years in parentheses that followed, is not the Goldstein in question. The correct anthropologist is Melvyn C. Goldstein, born 1938, current co-director of The Center for Research on Tibet at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
At least your addition of the characterization of polyandry in Tybet as being """"exceedingly rare"""" presently is, I'm sorry to say, unsupported by literature available already in 2001: See the PhD dissertation linked in its entirety from the Center's web archive of publications and other work on polyandry and family. 
I have corrected some of the above and made significant fixes in the Sources section, and  in the Polish-language version I prepared, the factual content reads correctly. The English-language version is still in need of attention, especially the inclusion of text documenting the revival of polyandry in Tibet de facto, which took place after communes fell by the wayside in China, and is blooming today, despite recent campaigns by the Chinese authorities to implement population control in rural Tibet from 1996 on.

re: Los Alamos High School

Basically I had stopped doing the wikipedia thing because I got tired of babysitting Peter Ekman (the notorious groper of eXile infamy).

But this article for LAHS had atrophied so much that I was kind of offended after all the work I put into creating it.  Apparently LAHS is most notable for the rate it graduates Wikipedia vandals.  I saw that you got rid of some of that, btw, so thanks.  Anyway I went back and fixed it up.  I know you're busy with the PhD and everything but when you get a chance maybe you could advise me how I could take the horribly pixelated LAHS logo and turn it into a smooth vector graphic.

In Sonoma County the exemption rate is 52% for the private school, 71% for one charter school, and 88% for the other.  The state average for personal exemptions is less than 2%.  Moving to the rest of the state provides similar numbers.  The schools can claim that this is not an official policy, but I did not argue that it is official policy, only that the numbers are true and that they are verifiable.

My edits have been deleted with the argument that the verifiable truth of individual school and county data is not relevant to a 'movement of over 1000 schools.'

Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added  do not comply with our guidelines for external links and have been removed. Wikipedia is not a collection of links; nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the  before reinserting it. Please take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. 

Your edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.

Please read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my . For more information about me, see . Thanks!   

Granted - yes, they are links.... but to PHOTOS intended for that particular entry. They are of the album, the tv show, and the video respectively.

Of course, a stupid BOT would not know this. I suggest a HUMAN review the data personally.

What we have here is five examples of typical church architectural arrangements teamed with five examples of buildings which fit these patterns. The names of the forms follow a convention (in the context of the sentence) and the names of the churches fit a convention (in the context of the sentence).    Changing the wording so that one out of five is different, in order to fit the link, doesn't work, in terms of expression.   

Also, the insertion of the word """"Anglican"""" in the names of the churches is superfluous in the context of the article, as Blacket was working for the Church of England at the time. The insertion of """"Anglican"""" into churches' names is a recent thing, and generally considered unnecessary, elswhere. While links may require the word, the context of the sentence (and most of the article) doesn't, so it's better to link as St Michael's, Surry Hills, until linking in the list below, where the full names of all the churches can be given.

GoodDay, the countries category is called just that, not 'Independant countries'. Wales, Scotland and England are countries (NI is not, but that's another matter). As they are countries they belong in the countries category, perfectly logically. In any case, this has been discussed repeatedly and the consensus is - as if we needed to be told! - that they are countries. Despite my opposition to the inclusion of the Six Counties - English Wikipedia has followed the political line of the New Labour UK government, a lie line which is contrary to the Belfast Agreement - I am tempted to agree with the compromise 'Category:Countries of the United Kingdom' but would like to hear other people's opinion as well. It's disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms 'country' and 'sovereign state'. BritishWatcher says above that he """"supported and accepted the fact England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should be called countries"""" but opposes them """"appearing on lists of countries (where only sovereign states are listed)"""". Therein lies the nub of the problem - the argument that although E, S and W are in fact countries they should not be listed as countries: talk about Alice in Wonderland!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

Hi Blnguyen - as you are a key contributor to this article, I would like to like to inform you of the changes I've made. Please don't take offense at the removal of data. My reasoning is this - speaking in context of the overall article, why risk removal of FA status. Its a subject on which there doesn't seem to be as many sources available. As a solution, I don't see why we can't just remove the non-essential sentences/facts without due citations - none of them seem critical or vital to the article. It won't diminish, as it doesn't seem people here can find any better literature. And is it worth risking the status of the overall article over those non-essential sentences? I don't think so. To be sure, I've left those alone which I felt were of some importance. Regards,  talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here is the original Arabic text from Ibn Baz's official website 

""""وبلغ أمير الأحساء وتوابعها من بني خالد سليمان ابن عريعر الخالدي أمر الشيخ، وأنه يدعو إلى الله، وأنه يهدم القباب، وأنه يقيم الحدود، فعظم على هذا البدوي أمر الشيخ، لأن من عادة البادية -إلا من هدى الله- الإقدام على الظلم، وسفك الدماء، ونهب الأموال، وانتهاك الحرمات، فخاف أن هذا الشيخ يعظم أمره، ويزيل سلطان الأمير البدوي، فكتب إلى عثمان يتوعده، ويأمره أن يقتل هذا المطوع الذي عنده في العيينة، وقال: إن المطوع الذي عندكم بلغنا عنه كذا، وكذا!! فإما أن تقتله، وإما أن نقطع عنك خراجك الذي عندنا.!! وكان عنده للأمير عثمان خراج من الذهب، فعظم على عثمان أمر هذا الأمير، وخاف إن عصاه أن يقطع عنه خراجه أو يحاربه""""

And this is how it translates (punch it into an automatated translator or show it to a friend if you don't believe it):

""""And news of the Shaikh reached the emir of al-Ahsa and its dependencies from Bani Khalid, Sulaiman ibn 'Uray;ir al-Khaldi, and it came to his knowledge that he called to God, and that he brought down the domes, and that he instituted the hudud [punishments], and so the matter of the Shaikh disturbed this bedouin, for it is the habit of the bedouin - except those whom God has guided - to rush to commit injustice, bloodshed, expropriation, and violation of prohibitions, so he feared that the power of this Shaikh may increase and do away with the power of the bedouin prince.  And so he wrote to Uthman, threatening him, and ordered him that he must kill this mutawwa that is with him at 'Uyayna, and said: 'this mutawwa that is with you, such and such has come to our knowledge about him!!  Either you kill him, or we cut off the dividend that you have with us', for the emir Uthman had [an annual] dividend of gold in the custody of [al-Khaldi].""""

No comment.

Now, I haven't been able to find a trace of the English version of this book online, but I would really appreciate it if you could confirm that it actually introduces the word """"Shi'ite"""" in there.  If it does, then I would love to find out where I may find a copy, or at least what government ministry is in charge of printing it, because I would like to post the info on the Bani Khalid's official website so that they could file a complaint and have this error rectified.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Hi . Just to be clear, I haven't made any threat. You misunderstood. I told , that if he will vandalize Vaslui articles again, I will report him to the admins. I didn't said anything about me to block him, because I don't have this kind of power. Starting three or four weeks ago, an anonymous user, kept editing on Vaslui page, false information about the team. The media speculated many transfers, and this user edited them all as being sure transfers. This was for almost three weeks, when I just couldn't keep revert his edits anymore. So I started to reedit every single information from Vaslui page, and linked every sentence (because there was no reference before), and I applied for semi-protection for SC Vaslui page. After I got the page protected, there was no longer any false information, until  edited again one of the players who just signed for Vaslui (back then, he wasn't). I saw his contribs, and noticed that he is 13 years old, and is a big SC Vaslui fan, and he edited almost the exact pages the anonymous editor wrote before. I don't think that's a coincidence. However, I noticed he has no current activity, so I think he either got my message, or he was blocked by admins. Either way, I'm more than happy. Hope you see this message, and reply me.

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

 My Statement 

Oh wow, I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone? I guess I can take on each point...

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd (also... if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying... what do you really expect?).
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping. 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion. I was told multiple times to fuck off (btw, when told to fuck off, I am considerably less likely to comply).
 . They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network. That being said, rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion (he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki; he hasn't gotten over it). I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry.
 User:Georgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings. A vandal can be warned four times but a user once? Hmmmm...
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped. He had every right to block for a violation of WP:NPA tens of times.

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and, although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification, I think the section could be considerably reduced - particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league.

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down, removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments, a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an in-text link to the various articles on the regional tournaments. By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.

Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer.

I will neither resort to insults nor put any words in the opponent's mouth like you just did. Instead, I will stick to the point. The matter of fact is, you cited regulations only partially, leaving out the regulation that warns about bias. It says (interpreted) that all authors and all sources are by definition biased, until filtered through neutrality checks and balances. So stop raising references alone to the pedestal of allmightiness. They alone are insufficient to establish that there is no bias (in them and otherwise). They must have an outside check. In historical science the check is called primary historical document and it supersedes all references ever written on history. In this case it is the Ottoman military records, used to create List_of_Ottoman_sieges_and_landings#Growth_.281453.E2.80.931683.29 and Eyalet#Eyalets_in_1609.

 I need some help 

Hello, I see you are a custodian, saw your message on the fair use issue. I am in the middle of negotiating with a photographer for a free license on an image posted previously as a fair use item. He wants it to be in Wikipedia but there is a language barrier and he needs help understanding what his choices are. I am worried am going to explain it poorly to him. He is from Switzerland and asked me to keep it simple and short how I explain it, not send him a link to a legal manual. Can you help me? I am conversing with him via email. I do not want to post his email address publicly here unless I get his approval. If you want to talk to me in email about this, my email address works in my box here. It is about an image Chowbok tagged and an additional one as well so I don't want to delay explaining the licenses to this person. I don't want him to be confused. He is a professional. I want him to understand well enough that he even opts not to license it if it is not best for him. We could try to get something else if it is not the right thing for him. But I think he would like to do this if we can just help him understand. What protects his photo credit best? GFDL? CC BY SA? Also, the GFDL mentions in the text that someone copying 100 copies or more must be given the source code, which is meaning a software package. For a photo, I hope the """"source code"""" would not be any greater image than what he gives us to put in Wikipedia. He may even decide to give us a bigger image than what we have up currently. I am in the middle of trying to answer this photographer and am worried I'm going to write something he won't understand or that's too long. –  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My view on this is probably similar (but probably not identical) to Cirt's. Speaking for myself, I have two problems with the use of """"Calvinist"""" on this basis: (i) there are multiple ways that calling a website 'The Calvinist Corner'  the most obvious is that Slick is writing from a Calvinist perspective. Another might be that he is writing about Calvinism. To take the former as true, and draw the the conclusion that Slick is a Calvinist is an inference and thus WP:Synthesis. It's most probably true, but not the sort of thing we're meant to be doing on Wikipedia. (ii) There's a fairly strong Calvinist thread through much (most?) of conservative evangelical Christianity. There are probably dozens of articles where we could find a similar level of evidence for applying the word 'Calvinist'. We don't, and to my mind shouldn't, unless a WP:SECONDARY source feels it sufficiently relevant/important a description to make use of it. This means that such articles aren't 'loaded up' with true-but-of-doubtful-relevance WP:IINFO descriptions. I suspect that part of the problem is that much of the secondary-source writing concentrates on CARM rather than Slick personally. However this simply means that, per WP:DUE, we should follow suit.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information.

Something should be mentioned in a new section, titled """"Technical Problems"""". 
Addition of """"YLOD"""" has been discussed here in the past and the main reason it hasn't been included is that there weren't any reliable, notable sources discussing it. It's mainly talk on forums and on fansites which is original research and therefore cannot be used. I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established. Regarding the firmware update that """"bricked"""" some consoles. This is covered in the PlayStation 3 system software article. Chimpanzee -  | Talk | Contribs 

A huge problem with the video game industry is fanboyism. Criticizing a product is basically a declaration of war. Anyway, the problem is at least known and suggested. I found this briefly searching for a reliable source. Maybe add a little blurb about it being suggested?   

Wait, let me get this straight: you think we should include a blurb about how high hardware fault rates have been suggested, but proven wrong? That sounds kinda like a little bit of undue weight to me. Every piece of hardware that is ever mass produced has a certain failure rate, and unless that failure rate is oddly high (like the 360) it's not goi",0,0,0,0,0,0

 AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3   

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3  
 Intolerance and Impatience of Armenian (or close to Armenian) Guys About the COUNTER ideas on 1915 Events 
The user Erpert THREATENED TO BLOCK me in my talk page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:212.174.38.3) via the pretext that 
""""1. using of talk page for inappropriate discussion"""", 
""""2. Adding defamatory content"""".

That is why the discussion of 1915 Events cannot be continued objectively. One of the sides (Armenians) do not want to hear any counter thoughts let alone to see a counter writing in such a FREE Wikipedia environment! 212.174.38.3

Delete redirect pages from my old user subpages  and  and the user talk subpages  and .
Delete my user talk archive subpages and all other user talk subpages .  Note that my talk page is structured so that archives are copy/paste.  Therefore if you left me a comment last year you will still have it in your contribution log (something which I think is generally important to maintain as long as the user who left the comment is active, barring truly exceptional reasons to delete user talk history).  
Delete my user subpages, listed here. Be careful that if the subpage is a redirect to a different namespace page, such as a Signpost article, you delete the redirect but keep the actual page it points to.
Blank my userpage and delete the page history, which is several hundred revisions. I'm not sure how you want to do this, but when you're done there should be a single revision with an edit summary of """"blanked the page"""" or similar, and nothing from beforehand.  Leave the full protection in place.
Blank this talk page.  Leave the revision history alone because, as above, I believe it benefits other people for it to stay, even though it does me no good.
On a non-technical note, thank you for doing this.  It is unfortunate - and despite what others might think, not entirely my own doing though certainly that was part of it - that my extensive contributions to the encyclopedia have been overshadowed by other issues which should have been forgotten long ago.  I hope that as a result of my action, those issues actually will be forgotten.

 I just wanted to say . . . 

that you were a horrid admin and really mean person. You lacked focus, commitment and neutrality. I'm jolly glad you're semi-retired and I'll dance the day you're de-sysopped. But, in a spirit of fairness, it'll be a dance of your choice.   

I've seen your dancing, it's crap. Why make a sad day even sadder? My only consolation is that you'll likely get blocked before Jennavecia gets desysopped. She's one of the few administrators I think wikipedia would actually miss.  Fatuorum 

I was actually a really good admin. And I may have my mean moments... I don't know who you are, but I get the impression that you're an idiot, so I suppose that's your justification for calling me mean. I was not required to be focused here, to say I lacked commitment is just stupid as hell, and neutrality... well, I suppose it depended on the situation. I couldn't care less if you're jolly, but you can save the dancing for the day I retire, which may be today, and I recommend holding your breath until I'm desysoped... since it won't happen. I've never abused my tools, nor would I. Not to mention, it's practically impossible to desysop an admin here. I do plan to resign though, so you can dance for that too. But just know this... As I walk away from this place, you can kiss the view. vecia 

I just wanted to say that Jennavecia is the most awesome person in the world, and anyone that says otherwise has their cranium up their anus.  We love you Jennavecia!  <3 .talk.contribs 

Hang on, let's not go overboard here. She did pretty well as an admin, but that's hardly a qualification for sanctification.

Every day I come to contribute to this admittedly well-intentioned website, there's some new template, some new project, some new policy (usually arcane and for the benefit of the person who quotes it), some new shortcut, some funkified userbar or some such.

THE USED WORDS OPENLY MAKE THIS ARTICLE A VERY BIASED ONE

I would like the person who wrote the line that """"an increasing number(!) of Turkish intellectuals"""" support the genocide THAT HE SHOW SOME REFERENCE and PROOF.  Also the SO-CALLED fact that over a million Armenians are killed IS A VERY DUBIOUS ONE AND REQUIRES SOME PROOF. WHAT MAKES WIKIPEDIA, WIKIPEDIA IS THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A TRAGEDY AS IMMENSE AS 9/11, IT PRESERVES ITS NEUTRALITY. HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS ARTICLE NEUTRAL IF IT SMELLS HEAVILY BIASED? For example the VERY IMPORTANT START PARAPGRAPH SHOULD BE MODIFIED  LIKE , SAY 

"""" It is also alleged that over a million Armenians were killed during the relocation etc...."""" 

OTHERWISE;  you have to show immediate references or supporting articles, proofs etc. I would like to receive those proofs, if this is really a documented proof, I very much would like to read them.  
PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS !

No academic research , conducted in Turkish Republic, ever denies the fact that """"MANY"""" Armenians were killed during the relocation but """"A MILLION"""" IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE.

Just because there are some PUNKS ( Do they call themselves System of Something? ) who make their homeland's propaganda, does not mean that you can falsify the history.

PLEASE REFER TO THE RESPECTED HISTORIANS( MANY OF THEM ARE NOT TURKISH) WHO DENY THE SO-CALLED GENOCIDE...

I WOULD LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO CONTROL THIS SITE, CHANGE THESE BIASED LINES IMMEDIATELY.

So all the sources on here saying that Ukip are centre right are wrong then. Your assumption that Ukip are right wing automatically means you are calling me right wing. I am not, my political spectrum is centralist, I do not agree with right wing party ideologies. Why would I join one? You are calling me right wing, so you will be waiting a while for your apology, when Ukip are represented in a true light and not by left leaning sources. You will get one. Next you will be telling me all the ex Labour , lib dems etc are right wing, even Reuters call us centre right: http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/08/ukip-replacing-the-lib-dems-or-taking-on-the-tories/

Or that Lord Stodart was once Labour and former councillors that were formerly Labour such as Derrick Huckfield (Staffordshire CC). 

Ukip are centre right.

Once again I will apologise when you with draw the remark that I am right wing, this is asserted by calling my party right wing. (",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Why LaVey anyway???? 

Well, so far, Reason Rules. The Neutrality sticker is still up, though LGagnon threatened, I believe, that it would only be temporary. Intellectually, I am actually rather satisfied to leave it at that.

But - Not!!!!!!!!! For one thing, I enjoy intellectual duelling much too much. All Hail Wikipedia! Ah, for the days of learning for the sake of learning!

I raised the question as part of my pursuit here: why LaVey? Why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, there's not enough room for everyone, so how were the selected selected? We know who is included. Who was excluded, or perhaps simply """"non-included,"""" i.e; unintentionally, in contradistinction to intentional exclusion?????!!

What is more, in view of the evolution of terrorism – to all intents and purposes –  virtually morphing  into a veritable weltanschauung, Timothy McVeigh takes on a new urgency, relevance and intellectual/philosophical challenge.

My fear is that the whole effort is loaded, biased, in violation of Wikipedia rules. The whole thing seems to be a charade to ride satanism in on the ratiocinative coattails of Objectivist Ayn Rand. Otherwise, again, why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, he explicitly mentioned, and is often discussed in terms of Randian libertarianism. She would disown him like a Bolshevik, of course, but then she would disown LaVey in utter disgust!!!! So, if there's room only for one of the two, why LaVey?

If I don't receive reasoned responses, I will edit LaVey out again. Again, boys and girls, my emphasis is on a truly Wikipedian neutral POV. AOluwatoyin

Oh, by the way, regarding my being blocked  on grounds of incivility, no less  LGagnon who started all the trouble, on the other hand, does not get blocked? He who refers to admins as """"vandal-coddling""""??!!! That's not """"incivility""""?!!!! Such revolting double-standards will not stand. I'm just getting warmed up, here!!!!!

Thank you, I have checked my email and found a delivery failure, well buried too, I have sent Ralf Vandebergh another request and expect it won't be too long before he replies, I'd say give it a few weeks, as he might travel, or not, I don't know what his schedule is. To put your mind at ease a little, I had organized through Ralf for his portrait to be released, it's on his article page. It's not a self-portrait, but it's the one he suggested and sent to me, and it looked fine in my opinion for inclusion. So he is keeping in touch with me and it shouldn't take too long. Something I brought up in the email I just sent is the option of people giving me permission to act on their behalf in these cases, do you know what form I can send to them for that, so I can release their pictures as I see fit, that would simplify things I think. Chris peat from Heavens-above is just like yep go for it, anything I like from his site, so it would be good if I get a once only form for these people, and they can suggest to me conversationally what they'd like to do, rather than use the forms all the time.  talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't really see why the article should valorise so yet another oddball theory about Lucy, especially as the Bateson 'incest' one is so much more plausible and yet not referenced. But as I say it's years since I did any Wordsworth reading. Of course critics have always tended to agree the Lucy poems were influenced by the intensity of William and Dorothy's relationship.
I see Wordsworth is actually underrepresented on Wikipedia. His sonnets are hardly mentioned (just the one poor article I can see). I might do a few articles if I can get hold of Moorman from somewhere.

 Long reply I'm afraid - hope it's helpful.

 It's possible - no people are flawless. But in fact it very rarely happens. I've been asked to investigate about 6 or so cases this last 9 months, by Irpen, Giano, Bishonen, at RFAR, on ANI, and others, but in most of those - in fact all but one or two in a nine month period, the channel actually functioned exactly as one would wish it to. The one case it didn't, I myself reported in full to the community at ANI, with full summary of the IRC dialog, so that it was made public in detail (a blocked admin had sought an unblock on dubious grounds, another admin had unblocked trusting that without sufficiently checking for themselves). 

 The problem with using """"IRC!"""" as a smokescreen is, those who go there know in fact it's extremely rare, so naturally it loses credibility and is seen as a way to further a """"politicized"""" agenda by those who have bad memories of IRC from years ago. We have an agreed structure to address problems in the channel, yet """"for whatever reason"""" those who feel there is a problem never actually come to me (or any channel operator) to have it resolved. They instead pass logs round, a move guaranteed to shed more heat, but not actually solve the problem. That to me says a lot; a person genuinely with a concern would ask to discuss it, and aim for resolution, just like any other dispute. These cases though are never used for dispute resolution, but only ever for dispute escalation. That seems to say something. 

 As for your specific question, again, yes, it's possible. But unlikely. Administrators, who undergo a quite strict and probing debate over their conduct and understanding of wiki-attitudes, are quite a varied bunch. They include diverse views - Bishonen, Lar, Coren, 1==2, myself, Carcharoth, to name but a few at random in this context. Any and all admins can go to that channel, and some 60 - 70 users on average are regularly there at any given time. They cover extreme diverse views too - to the point that no one stance can get much if any of a toehold there if it isn't proper. There will always be strong voices around. 

 RFA candidates will not be """"representative of the community as a whole"""". The community includes many vandals for example, under-represented at RFA, and many who understand policy well (probably over-represented at RFA). What is possible to say is, the users at #en-admins are probably representative of those users the community has deemed sufficiently trustworthy in judgement and clued in on wiki ethos, to use the tools. This shows in a few ways  for example, an outburst by a user (rare in itself) will often be addressed by general refusal to endorse it, and letting one or two users speak for everyone, or resolving in private chat to actually educate people how to handle things better, and that works very well. On-wiki, you'd get more people inclined to shout than fix. En-admins as a channel tends to look to fix problems by resolving them. When problems are visible, they get addressed. 

 They're also rather long suffering and (I suspect) used to the idea that bad faith will exist no matter what they say or do, and used to having their words pored over in a manner that nobody else would expect on-wiki, and misrepresented if necessary to create smoke. That's not ideal. It's a bit dysfunctional, as it encourages others to stir up problems that have little to no merit, make a large noise over a tiny number of tiny matters (major drama, someone used a bad word once and then when corrected by others agreed it was wrong a few minutes later, for example), to shout rather than approach those who might help, and so on. That kind of foolishness and """"hype"""" helps nobody.

 Lastly, it's worth noting that critically minded users play a very valuable role in that they can approach channel operators if they have concerns, on the spot, or indeed speak up in the channel. When they do, if it's merited, it is usually supported, and would indeed be the best way to effect disapproval or correction. I strongly encourage this, because I greatly suspect the number of cases that would be raised and found genuine would be very small, and they should be raised openly in the channel when noticed. But they probably only happen extremely rarely. To take an extreme case, suppose someone is present, believes an action is wrong, but says nothing, does nothing, and instead complains to a third party (non admin) who lacks all knowledge, but whom they encourage in a belief they have been conspired against. And all the time not broaching it in the channel, nor to any of the channel operators who have made their names known for exactly this purpose last month. This does the community a disservice. Such matters should be named openly to channel users, or privately to channel operators, if they are felt",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Re: History merges 

The instructions are all laid out at Wikipedia:How to fix cut-and-paste moves. As I found out quickly, when you try to move an article from Title A to Title B and Title B already exists, the software will automatically delete the edits of Title B for you when you move the article. Try to minimise the number of revisions you need to delete and restore as deleting and restoring pages is one of the most taxing operations in MediaWiki. Also, it's a good idea to say in the move summary that the move shouldn't be reverted. Once I was history merging Melbourne, and a well-meaning editor tried to move it back while I was working on the history merge, which resulted in Melbourne disappearing from Wikipedia for a few minutes. Maybe I'll try the same thing at Auckland one day -). Hope this helps some. ''''''87 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Union of states
I am surprised that it got reverted again to federal republic . The issue in question here is whether India is a union or a federation. The Indian Constitution defines India as a Union of states and as such an Encylopedia article like this should reflect that. I am more surprised by the foolishness of some editors here who think Wikipedia should not reflect realities but be based on some incorrect WP precendents. Maybe this is due to the fact the place where he comes from has no written constitution. But it is wrong to label India as a Federal Republic, when it is clearly not so.

The Devil's Tramping Grounds is located near Harpers Crossroads near Bennett.
 Charlie Daniels lived in the Goldston area as a child and graduated from Goldston High School. 
Chatham County is one of the few school systems in the state to not offer a middle school football program.
One of the only cases of a rabid beaver ever attacking a human in the US occurred during a rabies outbreak at Jordan Lake in the mid 1990's.
A secret government facility termed by locals as the """"Big Hole"""" was operated north of Pittsboro till around 1996. It was said the site was a virtual concrete city built several stories into the ground. The facility was actually part of the Autovon system operated under government contract by AT&T.; The site has reportedly been closed due to the introduction of the Defense Switched Network.
The clock currently in the county courthouse was a recent addition added to the courthouse. It was reportedly in the original plans of the courthouse, but for some reason was left out during its original construction.
Even though Jordan Lake is held mostly in the county's borders, county residents get very little drinking water from the lake. Most of the water is currently being sold to Cary and areas of eastern Wake County. These contracts have forced the county to purchase water from neighboring counties to guarantee sufficient supply in the county water system.
Many people moving to the Research Triangle area choose to live in the county because of lower tax rates compared to neighboring counties.
The geographical center of North Carolina is said to be near the Gulf community south of Goldston. This is debated since it is also said the geographical center of the state is in Montgomery County.
Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea) of Andy Griffith Show fame lived in Siler City and is buried there.
It is rumored that several of the costumes for the movie Titanic were actually purchased from antique stores in Pittsboro.
The county is one of the largest (in terms of land size) in the state.
Since the county is wedged between the Piedmont Triad and the Research Triangle many residents in the western portion of the county do most of their commerce in the Greensboro area, while those in the eastern portion do most of theirs in the Research Triangle area.
Pittsboro was once considered to house the University of North Carolina.
The county was once a leading shipper of wild rabbit meat. Around the turn of the century """"Chatham Rabbit"""" was a known delicacy in restaurants as far away as New York.
It is rumored that singer Clay Aiken recently built a home in an undisclosed development in the county and lives there full time.

Hi Star Mississippi,

We created a great new social network site www.homestayonline.com for homestay enthusiasts. It is the first of its kind in terms of technology features and more including online chat, groups, forums, and more... I think that it is the first of its kind in homestay. I launched on April 9th and so far we have 40 members. I tried to add it a resource page to Wikipedia homestay subject but it was removed. I may have used the wrong method to add it and I apologize but if very tiresome to try again. I wonder if you can help me do right thing or add it for me in the most appropriate manner. I also hope that it would stay, since the HomestayOnline network is expected goal is to grow by minimum 50 members per day by end of 2009.

I would appreciate if you can also log-in my site and see for yourself how this can help everyone. It is free of charge to join...

Let me know!

I see your point, but I think the difference is that we aren't talking about translations and romanizations. That is what we are using already (romanizations). For example Vegeta instead of Bejita or Vejita. Noone's using unnofficial romanizations, or straight romaji or kanji, which is why I get riled up when I see the """"use english"""" argument. So I hope I didnt come off as contentious. It's just that I think people misuse the word translation. I dunno if you saw the old Mr. Satan/Hercule argument. Points on commonality were certainly worth discussing, but a number of the more vocal people were insisting that Mr. Satan was a Japanese phrase and Hercule it's translation. That isn't what translation is. The thing is, and I think a lot of people forget, is that English-language wiki is a language choice, not a subset of countries that we are allowed to write articles about. English wiki is worldwide, like every other wiki. Most other wikis get this too. Look at the French wiki. The French dub named Piccolo as Satan (Kami being god of earth, they figured his evil counterpart would be the devil) and then changed Mr. Satan to Hercule (that's where the name comes from). But the articles their were on Piccolo and Mr. Satan, making note that when adapted into french the names Satan and Hercule were used.
On attacks- those are likely going to be restructered soon anyway. As for why in most cases we used names from the Daizenshuu attack list, it is because that is the only comprehensive list that exists. I have tried... really hard... to work such a list based on the dub and even Viz manga. You can't. The manga doesn't cover every aspect of the series and misses some attacks, and Viz is weird with attacks (keeps some the same, half-translates some, translates some into Chinese). The dub has some that are the same or translations, some with names invented for the dub, some attacks misnamed as other existing attacks, some attacks with multiple names, and some attacks without names at all. For example, Piccolo's old signature move that you see in games more often now was the Bakurikimaha. You saw it when he attacked Raditz on the cliff. Gohan's first signature was the Masenko. According to the dub these two distinct techniques are the same move and called Masenko-ha. Goku's last ditch move is the Genki Dama and Yamcha's signature ki attack is the Sokidan. According to the dub they were both Spirit Bomb, and the Sokidan has also been renamed Spirit Ball. Tenshinhan's signature Kikoho has been called between dub, manga, and games the Tri Beam, Blast Cannon, Ki Blast Cannon, and Chi Kung Blast. It just gets confusing trying to keep track. And then there are moves that don't get named, like Freeza's Death Ball pr the Big Bang Attack. They get named as such now because of video games, which are translated from Japanese, which goes by the Daizenshuu list, so any attack that doesn't have a dub rename tends to be some form or translation of the original name (since no dub equivolent exists for them). 
 I really hoped that makes sense... its like 3 in the morning here, so if it didn't let me know and I'll clarify.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi PR. Sorry your article was deleted. Argument-by-exception doesn't tend to work here: previous creation or deletion of articles has no bearing on the creation or deletion of other articles. However, if you have a specific reason to object to another article's existance (other than """"my article was deleted so this one should be deleted too"""") then you need to tag it with {{subst:afd}}. That produces a tag that gives you access to the AfD process. Follow the red link it creates and on that new page add {{subst:afd2 | pg=PageName | text=Reason}}~~~~ where PageName is the name of the article (case sensitive) and Reason is your detailed reasoning why the article should be deleted. Finally, go to WP:AfD. There's a link marked """"Add a new entry"""".

Secondly it is not my claim that there are 250,000 Cornish people so what are you going on about? All i have added of late is that a recent survey found that 44% of the Cornish populace thought themselves Cornish rather than British or English.

 Four Edits in 24 hours: True.  But it takes 2 to Tango. 

{{unblock|reason=You asked about the State Bar article, and that's fair.  In chronological order, on September 2 the article was """"protected."""" Why? The history shows that from August through November (4 months) the article was protected because the user SantiLak repeatedly vandalized the article.  The edit history, also shows that SantiLak reverted the article without any discussion whatsoever four times within 24 hours. He was warned previously by an Admin, but just took the warning off his Talk page and continued the pattern. Yesterday, the pattern continued.  I was merely attempting to keep the material from being deleted again without discussion.  If you find me in violation, I respect that. But at least, hold SantiLak to account as well because the history clearly shows he reverted 4 times in 24 hours, causing the article to go into protected status.  It’s up to you.  Whatever you decide, have a great day there’s nothing personal about this for me.  I just hope an article about a public entity does not get stripped to the point where it become little more than an advertising brochure bereft of noted criticism of that entity by the courts, mainstream news sources, and even former employees.  It’s a public entity, not a real person.  Some latitude seems appropriate, and some discussion before taking out huge chunks of information four times within 24 hours.

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~",1,0,1,0,0,0

Well, I showed you that """"Kievan Rus"""" is used in books more frequently than """"Ancient Rus"""". How is this not """"convincimg""""? Is the counting rigged? You may go check other encyclopedias and come back tell us what you find out.

As to redirects, you are right. No rules prohibit creation of redirects from sensible titles. """"Sensible"""" is pretty much inclusive and a redirect from Ancient Rus is alredy created. The types of redirects that are not allowed would not be created in good faith anyway. Under whatever name you think this may be found in English or whatever name you think the reader  looking for this article might enter into a search string, redirect is always a good idea. What's not allowed are only redirects that are POV pushing through promotion of POV term or non-existing term. Like it's not OK to make Little Russian a redirect to Ukrainian and instead the redirect should be to Little Russia, an article about the etymology and usage of the term. You cannot also invent a term and start pushing it into usage by creating a redirect article under it. Most of the rest is not a problem. Ancient Rus redirect is certainly a good idea.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.
 I'm sure the other states have similar legislation.   (Fuck you!) """,0,0,1,0,0,0

I have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it's a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with """"Main article: ..."""" just under the heading of each section. What I don't like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.

Although the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, """"preimage of the neutral element"""" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the """"General Case"""" section. (The """"Mal'cev algebra"""" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. 

Null space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.

Hmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0,0,1,0,0,0

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.  Contact me as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!one1111111111111111won1111

More thoughts
Hi KW - I noticed this thread whilst I was on my wikibreak and since I didn't have sufficient time/internet access, I made a note to comment. Before I begin, I'd like to apologise for the accusation of harassment, whilst I was feeling harassed by your comments I believe I over reacted due to the off-wiki stress of moving house. With that agreement above, I'm hoping we can move on. I'm hoping to get RfA Reform wrapped up 2012, there's been some very good research done, a few very resonable proposals which will be brought to the community to decide on them (even if I don't personally agree with them). 
You mention above that the RfA Reform project is dead without an an article writer as a leader, though you and I disagree on what constitutes an article writer, I would love to see one of those names helping in the project - even as co-ordinator. However, since none of them has shown any interest in RfA Reform and they are all busy with other things, I'm not going to hold my breath. Please do feel free to nudge any of them though - I'm sure a comment from you would go down much better than one from me, since I haven't interacted with any particularly. 
As for the unsavoury behaviour towards editors, I am actively trying to minimise this. For example, Keepscases, I did much research into his questions in the last quarter of last year, who removed them, how they were answered and so on. I don't believe I published it on wiki, though I could dig it up for you. From that, I came to the conclusion that Keepscases questions were not a major issue - and discussed that with a few of the editors who had issues with that user. I don't believe there has been any comments regarding Keepscases since, though I know there are still editors who are unhappy with the questions at RfA.
Regarding Malleus Fatuorum, I do endorse a topic ban from discussing administrators, as I believe that would remove the majority of problems and would be a much better solution than a blunt instrument like a block. Unfortunately, that does mean also topic banning him from RfA, which is a pity because his votes generally appear to be well worded (it's the comment's outside the votes, and the comments at WT:RfA which are problematic). In any case, that's a personal opinion, which I've explained with evidence at the the ArbCom case. If ArbCom choose to disagree, I'm not going to persue that further. 
All in all, I'd love to see RfA Reform actually improve RfA - I'm not 100% it can, because of project wide failings, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. I'm hoping to do some work improving the de-sysop process too, I'd like to see a more clear system there too. Finally, would you mind laying off the """"RfA Deform"""" comment? It belittles the project and only serves to make things more difficult, you are the only editor who uses that phrase - so I'd appreciate it if you could drop it.  · (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The determination of reliable sources in relation to determining the scientific consensus is whether or not they are independent, third party sources with no reason outside of scientific validity for coming to such conclusions. That is not the case here, all the studies you've cited """"disproving"""" a link have financial ties with the vaccine manufacturers, such as the AAP, the people who did the study in the New England Journal of Medicine etc. The JAMA study in Denmark was done by people with ties to vaccine manufacturer Statens Serum Institut, and omitted 10-25% of Autistic cases in the earlier findings to give the illusion of a constant rate of Autism increase after thimerosal was removed in 1992, even though today the Autism ratio is 1 in 1500 as opposed to 1 in 500 then. The AAP, the website where almost all the other studies are described has considerable ties to the vaccine industry as do Immunization branches of public health. If you want to examine a fringe minority position, include only independent researchers in the controversy and then make the evaluation over which side can be considered """"fringe.""""

Hello!  informed me that you were asking some questions about why the article you wrote, Offley Place, was speedy deleted. As I am the administrator who deleted it, I'll give you some brief rationale according to Wikipedia conventions and policies. I'm glad you have decided to contribute to Wikipedia, and I hope you continue to add to the project in the future. However, the article Offley Place as you wrote it met the criterion for deletion for two reasons:

The article did not indicate why the subject met the criteria for inclusion that apply to businesses and organizations.
It did not contain any verifiable, third-party references.
It was written in a promotional, rather than an encyclopedic tone. 
It appeared that the only contributor to the article (you) had a significant conflict of interest with the article subject. That is, it appears that your reason for adding the article to Wikipedia is to promote your business, rather than to improve the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia.

Though your first article did not meet the standards for inclusion in an encyclopedia, we hope that you will continue as an editor here. For more information about Wikipedia policies and guidelines, I suggest you take a look at the five pillars of Wikipedia. If you have any more questions, please feel free to let me know on my talk page.

Notability of Brandon Barger
A tag has been placed on Brandon Barger requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that this might be an oversimplification of the matter, as it depends largely on both the type of rigging being used and the direction (relevant to the wind direction) that one wishs to go.

For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.

In short, while the pressure differential as cause of movement remains valid, the cause of these pressure differences is not the same as for wings.

Lift (force)

Anyway, hope this helps.

As WP:OI says,
Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy.
The published information which is the basis for the annotation (i.e. the three letters/arrows) is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map  and also in a footnote to the map's caption  i.e.
Macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast, the location and circumstances of the accident, and the location of Gage's lodgings and Harlow's home and surgery..
Thoughts on this? As with the image links, I've put the map back so we (and others) can see what we're talking about.   

A9 Proving a negative
This regards a recent edit  to the passage 
Macmillan's comprehensive survey of accounts of Gage (scientific and popular) found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes...
which removed the word comprehensive.

This is a delicate point and I want to come up with something everyone can live with. I think there are two questions here.

First, Was Macmillan's analysis indeed comprehensive? No one who's been participating have any doubt on that, but just in case, open the collapse list.

""""first rate example of carefully done historical work"""" (Psychological Reports, 2001)
""""obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered (Cortex, 2004)
""""fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend"""" (Lancet, 2001)
""""Even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information..."""" (Neurosurgery Quarterly, 2002)
""""The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""" (Science, 2000)
""""Macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding Gage is concerned this must be a definitive work.  (History of the Human Sciences, 2007)
""""Macmillan has shown that the record of how Phineas Gage’s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution..."""" (New England Journal of Medicine"""", 2004)

Second, Do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? IMO I think we do, because it the analysis assserts a negative, which requires extraordinary research; just saying Macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. (Two examples from the collapse box: """"Macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered""""; """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""")Without such a clear statement, we get edit summaries such as this one: .

Actually, there's a third question: Do we need to include a quotation (such as the """"further research is not necessary""""  above) supporting the comprehensiveness? I don't think the reader needs that. I had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness  in other words, the quotation was there for editors, not readers, and this discussion can take its place.

So what I suggest is that the article say Macmillan's comprehensive analysis of accounts of Gage...'', where [97][98][99] cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness, but without quoting them. What do you think?

Yes Mr., this number add up to more than 100%. This is because most of the Ahmadis does not show up there identity as Ahmadis in Pakistan. Secondly I agree with Mr.. -Definition of Muslim upon which all Muslim scholars agree is """"Muslim"""" means a person who believes in the unity and oneness of Almighty Allah, in the absolute and unqualified finality of the Prophet hood of Muhammad, the last of the prophets, and does not believe in, or recognize as a prophet or religious reformer, any person who claimed to be a prophet in any sense of the word or of any description, whatsoever, after Muhammad. All suni/shia scholars agree on this definition. For more detail you can see the authenticated books of both sunni's and shia's, you will find same words. But Ahmadis call Mr.Ghulam Ahmad there Prophet as stated here: Prophethood (Ahmadiyya). Thats the reason they are not allowed to call themselves as Muslim. Other Muslim countries do not declared them non-Muslims but Pakistan because this movement was started in India/Pakistan.

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't. Whatever Larry Gambone says (I see that's where you've been taking your Proudhon quotes from, which is I guess why you never give decent references), there is certainly inconsistency - or at least, a greater degree of complexity than I think you are willing or able to accept, in Proudhon's work. But then who isn't inconsistent? As I said, it's not hard to find quotes in Proudhon that are against anarchism or that support property (in the full-blown sense). That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

And there's plenty more in that vein. 

'What Is Property', which is on the net, is not as clear but he does also call all forms of government illegitimate there. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My understanding from reading the article is that The Definitive Biography of P. D. Q. Bach gives the DoB as 1 April 1742 and the DoD as 5 May 1807; it's just his grave where the dates are shown the other way round, followed by a question mark. On second thoughts, the bracketed form for DoB and DoD in the lead might lend itself to the reverse order plus a question mark. I admit that my removing the circular link to Baden-Baden-Baden was done from a """"Wiki-instinct"""" and not appropriate for this page.
 the dates altogether from the lead seems rather dour and I suggest to reinstate this or a similar version:

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

Dear Samir,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.

Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Acceptance of reposted article 

I see that you accepted a draft article on Jason Binn. When you did so, presumably you were aware that an article by the same title had previously been deleted as a result of an AfD discussion. (If you weren't, then I suggest in future you should check for any deletion log for any article before you create it.) Even without any previous deletion history, I would have found your acceptance of the draft open to question, as it was distinctly promotional in tone, and its sourcing was largely to sources which were not independent (e.g. his own magazine, a press release, etc) or did not give substantial coverage of him. However, in light of the previous AfD deletion, you should have been particularly cautious about accepting the draft. The editor who uses the pseudonym """"""""  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I hope Mr. Wessely that one day you will go to Akureyri and visit the graves of the children who died from ME. I hope you will contemplate that the propogation of ME as a functional disorder has marginalised and distressed children within schools so that they are picked on by fellow pupils in a way that children with physical disabilities and even severe autism no longer are. They are often even looked on by the mechanisms that are supposed to protect children in schools as psychiatric cases rather than those suffering a severe physical illness. I hope that at Akureyri you will pause and ask yourself the question """"Perhaps I was wrong?"""". To do so would allow me to see a glimmer of humility in the task of service you have been asked to undertake by us your patients; that of a physician.

This is not funny, guys. Look at their respective article's pictures. It looks like someone took the Pratchett pic, rotated it, and changed the subject's outfit. Personally, I'm surprised that Dan Brown (the name that I'm currently using for Randi/Pratchett until I figure out what his real name is) didn't bother to dye his hair. 

Adding to the suspiciousness is the fact that both of them have had heart complications. Very CONVENIENT heart complications, which allows """"Pratchett"""" and """"Randi"""" to make public appearances in two different locations.

That is a bit much to tackle all at once, so I'll start with the basics. Your edits removed a reliable source dealing directly with the topic (namely, the article from the St. Petersburg Times). Your edit also added material from a source which I believe is unencyclopedic and fails this site's sourcing policies. Both aspects make the article poorer. I will go into more detail once I have time to fully digest your argument, but for now, the Times article is entitled """"Doctor's syndrome a sham, board says"""". Our article reflects the content of that reliable source. I don't see any similarly reliable independent, fact-checked, third-party sources that have appeared in the intervening years to contradict that assessment - certainly the Board left the door open for medical science to corroborate Wilson's claims, but I see no reliably sourced evidence that such corroboration has occurred. Let's start with the best available sources on the topic, and follow where they lead - that's the gist of this site's policies and expectations. '''''' Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Bharatiyaji,

What is your view on where Vedas, Mahabharata and the Ashtadhyayi were composed? Can you briefly mention your views and if possible give us some references, so that we can examine them?

It is the view of the prominent scholars that these were indeed composed in the Punjab region. When I say 'Punjab region' I don't necessarily mean the Indian state of Punjab, which is just a small part of former Punjab.

Internal evidence from these books leads us to the same conclusion that they they were indeed composed in this region.

The article Hinduism in Punjab is still evolving. However you can see a hint of the historical information that is avaialble to us. 

Let us work together to make these article more informative to all.

Please do let us know in some detail of what you are looking for, and what perceptions we need to address.

Hope the picture is clearer: This page (currently) focuses primarily on slave practices in Africa prior to the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades and then with a brief section on how those practices in Africa were transformed by the slave trades.  Connected to this page are Arab slave trade, Atlantic slave trade both of which are pretty good (although I prefer Islamic slave trade).  Less good are African slave trade and Slavery in modern Africa.  The first is an invention, there's no books about the """"African slave trade"""" (Davidson's book of that title is about the """"Atlantic Slave Trade"""") and probably a POV title. This is not to deny an """"indigenous"""" practice or trade in slaves for much of history; but simply that the focus on """"African slave trade"""" is prominent on wikipedia but not in the major books on the topic. Much of its content has long standing tags, some very problematic sources, and POV writing style.  The page could persist but only as a short exploration of the participation of Africans on inland trade of slaves and slave raiding.  The Slavery in modern Africa seems to have a good structure and some good portions, but needs some heft and a title change.  In terms of content overlap, there is some significant content overlap between """"African slave trade"""" with both """"Slavery in Africa"""" and """"Atlantic slave trade"""" (largely because African slave trade is a problematic title and because it analytically wandered).  Most of the other pages refer to each other, but content does not appear to overlap. Idea for reorganization (I'll expand this to more editors, but want to see if anyone has any ideas here first): 1. African slave trade page gets merged into """"Slavery in Africa"""" or other pages as appropriate. 2. Slavery in modern Africa gets changed name to Slavery in contemporary Africa, as more appropriate. 3. Slavery in Africa page largely eludes to slave trades without devoting significant section to the topic, that stays with the slave trade pages themselves. 4. A new article on """"Emancipation movements in Africa"""" or something needs to be created. It is a major topic which is covered as much as the slave trades were ended, but then glossed over entirely by other pages. Any thoughts on this organization?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

And please, don't peronal attack me it is against the Wikipedias rules. Those who personal attack, like you do, calling me terrorist sympathiser, get punished with temporary or perament banning.  
You do like threatening users, don't you?  Except that I will not be intimidated.  You wrote in Wikipedia that there is an Albanian guerilla """"Liberation Army"""" operating in Greece: a patent and outrageous falsehood.

Question for Bratsche
If this discussion is to lead anywhere, you will have to formulate the specific, individual questions that need to be answered.   

 Albanau 

It has come to my attention that  has been actively promoting the existence of a """"Çamëria Liberation Army"""" on the Swedish Wikipedia,, identifying it and the more notorious UÇK of Kosovo with a struggle for """"human rights"""". This blatant promotion of armed Albanian extremist groups was later removed by another editor, but Albanau persisted, describing their actions as a reaction to """"cultural oppression"""". This reference too was later deleted as """"redundant propaganda"""". The existence of a such a group in Greece is in fact a matter of speculation, as later acknowledged by a fellow Albanian editor, and there is no reference to such a group on the English Wikipedia.

 Bridge to Teribithia 

Now that this anon has deigned to explain the removal of text, I've checked, and he or she is right; there is no mention of Young at IMDb, the film's page, or her own homepage. That User:Shelbyyoung has added this to the page on Shelby Young suggests strongly that she's not Shelby Young; moreover, if she were, she shouldn't be editing the article on herself. Mel Etitis (Talk)  

I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  

IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an """"alternate ending""""). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  

1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in """"Night at the Museum"""". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 
2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.

3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.

4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a """"popular"""" one that has been photoshopped. If so, where is it? I see no evidence of a photo looking remotely like that doing any sort of image search. Ispy1981 

Jiust to make clear on the last point, that I offered no such argument. Mel Etitis (Talk)

94812,fd7335d791075b92,"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

I'm not an expert on free blacks in 18th-century Louisiana, but I do know that under Spanish rule, which began in the 1760s, slaves were given the right to own property under the law of """"coartacion."""" Slaves were allowed to get a fair price for the property they sold. They could use their free time to sell produce in the markets, or hire themselves out as laborers, nurses, craftsmen or artisans. As a result, slaves under Spanish rule, could purchase their own freedom, and could petition the courts for freedom. Therefore, the if the legal status of an individual could change, then a slave could become a freeman, and could then become a slave-owner. This was common. According to an article appearing in the Encyclopedia of Louisiana, by the end of the Spanish period (1803), there were 1,490 free blacks in New Orleans alone that had purchased their own freedom. So, I don't question the statement that there were free blacks trading in the Avoyelles area in the 18th century.

Talk:Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as """"removal of spam"""". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is """"spam"""". I'd like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration, and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr. Gronowski.

great, but what I meant about weakest link is that I don't see an explicit connection to developments in noise music in the sources I've seen, have you got a source that place's something called """"post-industrial"""" in the context of the history of noise music? (I'm presuming this is the umbrella term invented by music journalists to cover any music that is stylistically informed by industrial music yet is at the same time far enough removed to warrant the 'post' tag).

Unless the sources are good on this, it's too divergent, in my opinion, to include right now. Some of what might be called post-industrial is not that far removed from pop music so it simply doesn't warrant inclusion. You might as well do a section on death-metal and its precursors, but this kind of bifurcatory dot connecting is hardly the best way forward; especially as the title of this article arose as a result of someone trying to define a single genre known as """"noise music"""".

Personally, I think it is perhaps a stretch too far to start covering any kind of music, or any composer/artist, that might have dabbled in a bit of noise making, and I don't think that is what should happen with this article, unless the claims are sourced, and that's why I mentioned already that we should try and stick as closely as possible to what the main sources dealing with the historical use of sound/noise in music have to offer. We now see a number of artists (for example Jeff Mills) being redefined as a post-industrial musicians?? and the sentence throws in the year 2000 despite the fact that Mills has been associated with techno for 20 years now. I find this kind of redefinition without strong sources problematic.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

 Unsourced POV paragraph. 

The following paragraph was removed from the article due to what I believe is POV. The paragraph is not sourced, and likely contains original research. Any thoughts, sources? 

Reactions from San Diegans
After the format move to 570, many who live in the San Diego area had complained that they were unable to get the station's new signal, fueling the complaint that AM 570 had """"Los Angeles-ized"""", and no longer catered to San Diego's sports teams and listeners.

This also came to the attention of Premiere Radio Networks, Jim Rome's syndicator; XEPRS-AM, """"the Mighty 1090,"""" a rival radio station that broadcasts in San Diego and parts of Orange County and Los Angeles (and run by the Broadcast Company of the Americas, whose CEO John Lynch administered XTRA Sports Radio in San Diego from the mid 1980s to its merger with 1150 in 2002), picked up The Jim Rome Show in September 2005. 

As the radio flagship home of the Los Angeles Lakers, KLAC normally put much more emphasis and focus on the team, possibly very much to the chagrin of listeners who are not supporters of the Lakers. This was especially evident in the midday program The Loose Cannons, then headlined by Hartman, Jacobs and Laker radio broadcaster and former player Mychal Thompson.

Roc Nation Template
Hi there ,

I'm sure you a nice person, but I would like to know the reason of why you have removed just the name of Tinchy Stryder and no other names on the Template:Roc Nation just under reason of """"Reverting edits by block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" when In fact I have been unblocked since 16 September 2011, and all the edits I have made to the Template:Roc Nation since the end of my ban have all been in good faith and correction of information and also of other WPA edits I have made from the knowledge I have on a specific WPA, have been made after my 1 month ban from the 16 August 2011 to 16 Sep 2011. So I just don't understand what you mean by """"block-evading sockpuppeteer"""" and when Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template way before I had made any edits to the template, and all I persume is that the reason why Tinchy Stryder's name was on the template in the first place was that he is a key member of Roc Nation due to him being co-owner of Roc Nation UK-based subsidiary Takeover Roc Nation record label and entertainment company, the same goes to Stargate (production team) who are the co-owners of the Roc Nation US-based StarRoc record label and publishing company. I would be grateful if you can give an explanation and if bias reverting of WPA edits, which is what this looks like in my oppinion is allowed by Wikipedia as I'm pretty sure it is not. I would like to think this is not a biased issue as I'm sure your a nice person . Thank you.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Verifiability 
I noticed you deleted all of my contribution yet again. It would be more helpful, not to mention a show of good faith, if you would participate in the process and edit my contributions instead of completely deleting them!

Now that you have removed the link to the powerbasic forums, and elected to not sanction the description of """"official"""" Powerbasic forum, perhaps some other relevant links would be appropriate. I agree with you that they are in fact """"user to user"""" forums and will reword my contribution accordingly. I also agree with your wording """"this forum is not a source of official support."""" Additionally, Your own website states: """"Should your request goes beyond the intent of the technical support and resources we offer for free you will be advised there will be a $49 per incident charge if you would like us to proceed with your request."""" So I am not sure why you deleted that too?

As I indicated, the last remnants of company support suddenly left the powerbasic forums with Lance in July 2004 as confirmed in the thread you quoted. As another member put it """"you may indeed be correct. lance's last post was july 5, 2004 and the last post that indicated he was powerbasic support was june 25... also, between march 6 and march 7 of this year lance changed his title from """"administrator"""" to """"member"""". if he is indeed gone i wish him a lot of luck!"""" It seems pretty clear that no one at the time had any idea what happened. But this is irrelevant and I only mention it because Lance provided technical support via the forums (as can be seen by any casual search of his posts). The current levels of participation in the forum by powerbasic staff cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered support.

Because 30 support posts of any real value in SIX MONTHS cannot be considered support, and there is no eveidence of alleged """"email support"""", my statement that """"little if any real support is offered"""" is valid. Support is a key issue to novice developers and should be clearly represented in the wikipedia entry.

Thank you for helping with the wording of """"there were 8508 total posts, not 8508 requests for help"""". This is perhaps a more accurate statement and as I have said all along I welcome your input. Since we agree on this number, perhaps you can justify your statement of """"18,771 messages in support of PowerBASIC customers""""?

The numbers I quoted are easily verifyable from your search engine. simply type in any of the historical support staff names like """"Steve Rossell"""" or """"Bob Zale"""" under """"User Name:"""", highlight the five forums in which users confine thier posts for help:
PowerBasic Console Compiler

PowerBasic for DOS

PowerBasic for Windows

Programming

Programming the Internet 

then hit search. If you look at page two you will see that posts in the last six months immediatly dry up. 
A grand total of 32 posts from Mr Rossel and 48 posts from Mr Zale.

A quick review of these posts shows that in fact Mr Rossel contributed 18 posts of any significant help and Mr Zale only 12 (leaving aside Mr Zale's recent spurt of enthusaism).

This is a verifyable FACT. Anyone can verify these numbers. This is not my opinion. Even if we include every post made in that timeframe as real """"support"""" we are still only talking about 80 out of 8500, thats still less than one percent! This is a relevant verifyable fact.

Your point 5 contains no references or even vague offers of proof. You mention Microsoft Visual Basic, seem to assert that Visual Basic users should be entitled to support from powerbasic staff etc etc. I am unclear how any of this is relevant? 

It is interesting to note that you use an internet archive to support your arguments about historical posts when is suits you, yet have so far to acknowledge that the post relating to the incompatability of unsigned integers was targeted and deleted. If you statement """"The truth is, we welcome criticism, as it's a key element in the evolution of our products"""" is true, then cite an example from your forums of criticism that has been embraced. 

In fact powerbasic would like to dodge all accountability as clearly demonstrated when this [thread was deleted.]
The user claims: """"This entire issue started when Bob challenged me to prove that PowerBASIC/Linux had ever been announced as """"coming real soon"""" and accused me of lying.
I provided the proof. (Linux is coming soon, and other platforms will follow.)

Yes, true. I never used the term """"anti-vax"""" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton """"Anyone who adopts the cause of the """"anti-vaccinator"""" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.""""  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed """"anti-vax"""", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10""",0,0,0,0,0,0

This party is being held at an artistic London venue with room for approximately 300 people, and is being funded by Ed Saperia, a non-Wikipedian who has a reputation for holding exclusive events all over London. This year, he wants to help Wikipedia, and is subsidising a charity event for us. We're keen to get as many Wikimedians coming as possible, and we already have approximately 200 guests, including members of the press, and some mystery guests! More details can be found at http://ten.wikipedia.org/wiki/London - expect an Eigenharp, a mulled wine hot tub, a free hog roast, a haybale amphitheatre and more. If you're interested in coming - and we'd love to have you - please go to the ten.wikipedia page and follow the link to the Facebook event. Signing up on Facebook will add you to the party guestlist. Entry fee is a heavily subsidised £5 and entry is restricted to over 18s. It promises to be a 10th birthday party to remember! If you have any questions, please email me at chasemewiki at gmail.com.

 Your sorting effort 

Wow! This will raise the number of assessed articles substantially. Do I understand the process correctly, that once tagging is done, a bot will generate overview and stats pages.

One minor caveat: Award articles, like Wigner medal, all seem to get the """"stub"""" category, per """"auto"""", allegedly because of a stub template. But:
 To the best of my knowledge those articles never had a stub template
 IMHO there is no big potential for expansion, either they
 should be considered list-like and excempt from article assessment
 be rated somewhat like """"short, but no need to grow""""  a seemingly missing assessment grade

Only a nitpick in the grand scheme, but I'm just watching a number of those articles, so I was wondering.

 Soriano is an international fugitive, it is a duly-sourced fact. Reliable, third-party, published sources are used in compliance with WP:RS. A broadsheet newspaper article came out saying that he surrendered, but after that another broadsheet newspaper article came out saying that it was faked and he did not really surrender. Can't you read? If he is really on bail and not a fugitive (an international fugitive at that) then why is he on the Interpol wanted list in the Interpol official website??? The link to that website is also used as reference in the article. Here it is. Your leader is a wanted man, you can cry blood but you won't be able to whitewash that reality. Your leader is wanted by the Philippine government and the Interpol for homosexual rape. If you type his name on the Google toolbar the suggestions """"Eli Soriano rape case"""" and """"Eli Soriano Interpol"""" automatically come up.

I'm not certain, but it seems possible that the article does not discuss the controversy at all, as from what I can gather it basically is discussing his work. This appears to be a primary document and is the sole source for a controversial claim about his professional life, though Taveira is discussed on that page, and the claim could be true. We cannot go off of primary sources for that kind of thing though.

 Link to Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr.""""  

This link Article: """"The Unknown Martin Luther King, Jr."""" has twice been removed by one particular editor, first with a remark in including the words """"What's next? a link to Stormfront?"""" which I do not understand, and later to dismissing the link as """"racist"""", which like many convenience-words ending in """"ist"""" can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean (often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion).  I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well-known leader.  The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (if this is what """"racist"""" means): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page.  But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well-written and reasonable, and therefore of interest.  As an experienced (non-American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.  And a variety of independent views expressed of a subject enriches, and is the way to approach the truth, like any scientific research: it is not for editors to filter links because they contain matter showing the subject to be less than perfect - we are all human - and I can understand that this might be the reason.

Enough.  Please can there be viewpoints on the relevance of the link to MLK ?  And consensus.  Welcome from the editor mentioned above and others.  Thanks.    
We don't link to fringe sites such as AmRen without a very good reason, and there isn't one here; the article in question is an opinion piece by a non-notable grad student, and is of no particular value to the article. Sorry you don't like the term """"racist"""", but it's an appropriate description for Amren. This article gets a vast amount of racist vandalism  that's why it's semi-protected  and non-vandalism pointing to racist sources is immediately and properly suspect. ∇∆∇∆ 15:""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the one that has gone far is the IP annonymous user. He reverts every edit users make in the Dominica Republic without caring about what other user believe. I been in wikipedia for past half a year and have made numerous articles and he is the first person that gotten me angry. Wikipedia is suppose to be a place for concensus not self edits like the annonymous sure did...Right now they are 4 people(counting me) that go against his policies and then he warns us of vandalizing the Article.

WE are dominican and we knoe the history of our country while he blames us that we are only racist and go against African Blood..I think you should warn him too the same way you did to me because the only one responsible of my acts is him.

You could ask users like User:Dominican,User:VirtualDelight and others that know the truth and that they always back my points while IP User:64.131.205.111. I never have come here to disturb and always got along with other wikipedians like User:Moebiusuibeom-en.

He Accussed more than twice about vandalism and i think that if you neutral enough you should warn his of being blocked too...He comes up here and make himself seem as an innocent editor while he is truly not.

There seems to have been a recent """"schism"""" whereby a number of former WR contributors have left (or been kicked out) and formed a new site called Wikipediocracy... the split was so acrimonious that WR even seems to have its own variety of BADSITES policy to ban all links and mentions of the other site.

 You Know What's Amazing... 
Is that there aren't more comments and contributions to this article in the """"Talk Section"""". but, given my very recent experience with illegal, self-appointed  censors (among other things,) why be surprised?  One person put a question about Alfred controversial activities concerning the """"Freddies Mart"""" case, and the terrorist action that led to several employees of the establishment killed in the fire. I responded to this for clarifcation. Later his edited section and my response were deleted. I give here again my thoughts.

Indeed, sir.  reliable sources including an earlier version of this this very article corraborating info I and many others have received over the years since the """"incident"""" concerning the case of Freddie's Mart's landlord, who was never cited by Sharpton! As for Rev. Al's perfidy concerning the UAM and Alton Maddox, who it must be strenuously reiterated rescued Alfred from the wrath of Morganthau, the New York State Attorney time and again, as well as the New York State Attorney Office! As for the statement of Sharpton's affiliation with Larouche (aka Lyn Marcus's) """"Revolutionary Youth Movement"""", although I heard that the former had been involved in the mid-70s with a predomiately African-American youth movement performing street organizing and canvasing in NYC, I didn't know the name of it until an earlier version of this very same article stated the name of it. (That earlier iteration seems to all purposes now omitted from viewing unless the author decides to put these item back in. I also noticed that there are many facts added to the present article; others understandbly taken out.)  Rev. Al doesn't make reference to this affiliation in any detail in his auto-bio, but that is his and his editors privelge of discrecton in such tomes:  What is not said is left for others to investigate.  What his involvement with RYM is something that the Good Reverend, the F.B.I. as well as other police agencies scrutinizing Al for the past 35-yrs, LaRouche,et al, and perhaps some of the surviving members of RYM to attest. Yes, I agree with you that this is information warfare, by any other name.  When has it not ever been so?  24.46.103.28  Veryverser""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Political question?
I not sure if this is """"political;"""" and in fact, I'm hoping it is not ....  

At WP:AN/I, you suggested a """"fresh start"""" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.

I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.  

The political question has to do with this military term.  How do """"depoliticize"""" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your """"fresh start?""""  

As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?

A further point: I really like the term """"fresh start""""  not as much as """"reset"""".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).  This would leave something like """"your"""" fresh start in the primary position.  

Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create """"Fresh start"""" as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived """"political"""" problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled """"Fresh start""""  with """"Reset"""" as a re-direct page?

 Jimbo Wales and Justin Berry 
It seems the owner of Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, has developed a close personal relationship with 19 year old Justin Berry, the former underage camwhore and adult porn webmaster recently profiled in a series of New York Times articles by writer Kurt Eichenwald.  At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, """"pedophile trolling,"""" which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a """"personal attack,"""" and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.

Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are """"copyright violations"""", even though Wikipedia is filled with """"fair use"""" pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.   

Way to go Jimbo, you're a rancid agenda-pushing piece of shit, and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turd-pile.  Perhaps you should rename this endeavor """"The Oprah Encyclopedia.""""  Fuck you.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People.

It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history?

 Kaballah and Tarot 

The article implies that Kaballah and Tarot weren't related until the 19th cent. occult movement. I assume that's a reference to the Golden Dawn. Or Papus. But that's more of an assumption than anything. The cards first appeared, albeit in a somewhat different format, at the same time and in the same place as a flowering of non-Jewish interest in Kaballah. 

I raise this here because 1) I'm not sure how to correct the article, 2) I'm a newbie and would rather not do harm in an attempt to do good, and 3) I'd like to see if anyone else has strong opinions.  

 
Tarot and Qaballah have a 1 to 1 correspondence, and are almost
certainly paralell descriptions of the same mythic archetypes.
The history presented here is propagandist christian; it assumes
that Tarot was started in Italy, which is patently culturacidal
because the cards are part of pagan European mysticism, and they
did all they could to kill off the pagans.
Italies versions were propagandist toy versions of the original,
copied without an understanding of the meanings and changed to suit
the assumptive interests of the new Italian art culture.

 """"1 to 1 correspondence"""" is one interpretation, but a poor one. Parallels between the Tarot and the Tree of Life have been drawn (Eliphas Levy?), but they do not parallel other components of the Qaballah, such as the texts on Gematria. While many neo-pagans have adopted and adapted the Tarot, I seriously doubt any kind of pagan origins (although I'd love to see evidence for such).  

 Could you offer any evidence for your statement of a Pagan predevelopment? The """"normal"""" knowledge about Tarot cards development in Italy lists various examples of really existing old playing cards called Trionfi and really existent documents which use this word Trionfi.  

 
yes, there is proof that the trionfi cards actually did exist.
No, there isn't proof that this is a verifiable point of origin.
Proof can be very hard to come by in a situation involving cultural
genocide, however, there are a variety of esoteric proofs and even easier to understand basic arguments.

The first of these is the simple question of sociology and anthropology. Okay, if Tarot is a product of Italian culture of that Time period, where out of that culture did those symbols derivate?
The answer is, they didn't and couldn't of, they were obviously
symbols from a system the Italians had no knowledge of.

 So YOU say, buddy. Can you please give us some proof that the Italians DIDN'T have any knowledge of tarot symbolism? And what symbolism! Empresses, chariots, the sun... the moon. A tower. All of it stuff with which Italians would have been completely and totally unfamiliar, huh?  Vince In Milan

Other """"proofs"""" as such hinge on increasingly more esoteric facts,
and, as weak an argument as the above sounds, if you know Tarot, it is a VERY sound argument as one starts to apply the basic principle
per card. The Tarot is OBVIOUSLY a wheel of the year mythic architecture, the Elementalist perspective would have been an anacronism in Italian culture of that time period.

new age noise, but another case of somebody who actually saw
the obvious;
http://www.psychicsahar.com/artman/publish/article_399.shtml

As a side note, Tarot suffered more than its sister system, the Tree
of life, which has also been revisionist histroied to start in the 13th century. Unlike Tarot, the proof of this is patently obvious to any who have studied esoteric judaism. The bibles symbols and images
are based on Qaballah, not the other way around. Everything is derivated in Judaism by virtue of the TREE, including even the hebrew
language. 

At the very least, we can show that the Trionfi is not the original Tarot by refering to the Tarot of the Bohemians.

If I really had my way, I would reorganize this page (and every other Survivor page) to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables, and then a block with each episode detail: in the case of Survivor, you'd have your episode summary, exile reasoning, and voted out reasoning all in the same block.  The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 """"Wow, this is Survivor"""" (John)"""": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).  I think the latter would satisfy the gut feeling that they should be on there without affecting too much of the page.  06:19""",0,0,0,0,0,0

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dubious sentence 

""""Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King's German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]""""

This is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.

There seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).

I think two events are being conflated here.  

Having become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu's Division (Reille's Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington's position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn't break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  

Simultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D'Erlon's Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.

 

If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - 

 Done (I'm bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare's words ;)  ) 

 Artillery 

One omission and one challenge. 

We should say something about Wellington's tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer's account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. 

Now the challenge. What's the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French """"batteries"""" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don't recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  

Adkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.

6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies

8th                4th company

2nd                7th company

Marines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)

Old Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.

 

Thanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.

I wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  

I vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington's position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.  

By all means change it.

Well, you may think It's ancient history, but the atated facts in the public record speak for themselves and need no cowardly apologist who apparently is running interferrance for Strom Thurman's many crimes. (Take this advice from an African-American. If you happen to be a foreigner, and Nordic European, then you already are suspected of being biased.
How else do you think he is related Rev. Al?  Strom's ancestor(s) raped one, or several of Al's enslved female ancestors!!!  However, given Thurmonds's age, circumscribing THREE CENTURIES, he probably raped several succesive generations of Al's women-folk.  Yet another """"creative"""" version of willful southern """"inbreeding""""  When Sharpton became publically known outside NYC (he was for decades earlier in the FBI's files, of which I suspect that Thurmond knew of him before then, given his special access to govenment files,) the old piking fart-child-rapist must have howled with satanic laughter that the descendant of one of his """"bastard whelps"""" became a black activist. (And before you, or anyone else start with the infantile objections, all this is in the public record, just a click and a scroll away!!!

In many countries he would have been able to win a defamation lawsuit about the statements quoted in our article.

By contrast, no one has pointed to any lies about Rick Santorum that would be squelched or even given less currency by the deletion/merger/renaming/whatevering of this article.  Compared to the swiftboating of John Kerry, the use of Santorum's name in a nondefamatory way is minor.

You have been blocked from editing for a period of 31 hours for your disruption caused by edit warring and violation of the three-revert rule at The Amazing Race 21. During a dispute, you should first try to discuss controversial changes and seek consensus. If that proves unsuccessful you are encouraged to seek dispute resolution, and in some cases it may be appropriate to request page protection. If you would like to be unblocked, you may appeal this block by adding the text  below this notice, but you should read the guide to appealing blocks first. Bbb23 (talk) 
I love how two editors can gang up on a third, including being so nasty that one of them draws a block for incivility, and it's me who ends up getting fucked by their bad faith actions. Excellent evidence for the proposition that when you give anyone a little power they'll abuse it. Great decision. Spot fucking on. Buck Winston (talk) 
[edit]Hmm

(Non-administrator observation) I've only taken a cursory look at the article, but it looks like you made a good point - I can only think of a handful of shows to have featured three gay characters in a season, and I'd agree with you that it should definitely be put in that category. Regardless, if you plan on making more edits like this and this, you might find yourself with a block extension. Bbb23's a good administrator, and 3RR's called """"bright-line rule"""" for a reason. And considering that edit-warring blocks are to get users to cool down, if this is how you responded, it looks like he made the right call. — Francophonie&Androphilie;(Je vous invite à me parler)

It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility.

They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs.

 Problems with """"Netbooks in education section"""" 

I feel like there are a couple of problems with the Netbooks in education section:

1) It doesn't seem to be written from a NPOV, and the tone is even a little advertisement-like. """"Netbooks have the potential to change the way students and teachers interact"""", """"The benefits of integrating netbooks in the classroom are many, but they are maximized when there is a 1-1 student to computer ratio"""", etc.

2) It's too long. I don't see any reason why this section should take up 1/4 of an already very long article. The """"activities"""" subsection is pure fluff. The sections on """"Effects on student learning"""", """"Costs and logistics"""", and """"Training and staff development"""", are basically fine, but they convey no information that's specific to netbooks. The information belongs in an article like E-learning.

My suggestion would be to keep the first two paragraphs of the section and chuck everything else (which is what I'll do in a day or two if there aren't any objections).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Eggshell

Thanks for your comments. They were very encouraging. We're hoping to go again at FAC in the next few days. 

The way I got involved with this article was that I opposed it at its last FAC about a month ago, felt guilty, and realised that I could probably meet my own objections, if I rolled my sleeves up. The links are just about last on the list of things to do: one goes down tunnels in this article and loses a sense of the overall warren. They are pains in the arse, though, especially things like Henry IV, I, 2, 3, plus the fact that Shakespeare unhelpfully named his plays after a bunch of Wikipedia articles.

I'm a history man, really, which is probably why the tragedy stuff comes over cacklike. It's hellish, though, trying to sum up 38 plays in four paragraphs, and I've probably relied too much on my Bradley.

The point is that we cannot prove that the editors who used the sources showing in google books search results only saw and used the snippet view.  If we are to assume good faith here, we should believe they did actually see the full texts, cited them, and provided the links to google books as the best available online target (it's better to have a link to a snippet view rathen than to nothing at all, wouldn't you agree?).  However, this does not mean you or anyone else cannot ever question the validity of these cites—what it does mean is that to be able to question them you'll have to have something better than logically-enhanced mind wanderings (such as one above).  Which brings me back to my original recommendation—find the books, read them, and if they indeed are not acceptable as references, remove the sentences in question.

 So, you want to be an administrator? 
When a contributing editor makes multiple individual contributions to an article in good faith,  a good follow up editor will evaluate each individaul contribution to ascertain the merits of each individual edit.. A follow up editor with a particular negative agenda toward the contributing editor will revert all the edits indiscriminately.

The impetus of course is if that particular reverting editor is desirous of admin. authority at some future date it would be prudent to make those determining the candidates """"agemda"""" apparent for consideration.

The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",1,0,0,0,0,0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

 novaseminary pov pushing,and section blanking.  So everyone is aware of his pov editing, I have copied some of his history here.  I ask other editors not to restore his versions as they are pov and section blanking.
Here is a little histoy on novaseminry. More can easily be found. I include it here to show the type of editor he is.
 
Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman)
 
User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.
 
But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
 This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 
Unfortunately, it's more than a content issue. It's a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI """"may be the best first step."""" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) 
The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk) 
Fact is, unless admins enforce it, don't count on it. Otherwise I wouldn't have had to come here. I've suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article. He refused. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 

 
I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary's bizarre obsession with this person. I'm going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel 
 You know what? I'll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) 
I've never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) 
I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) 
Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same. From your comments above that the IP's edits are the only reason you've even been editing the page recently, this should be an acceptable resolution for you too. Right? – Steel  Yes. Novaseminary? I do agree that you have an all-too strong interest in that article. Drmies (talk) 17:16, 13 October",0,0,0,0,0,0

My dear  argues:

You can't use the term some critics when you're listing the same bloke twice ...(my emphasis: heh, it is a 'blockquote' too;-)

As long as the Universe of Discourse contains at least one member with the predicated quality logic tells me I am empowered to use the existential quantifier. In English, that's some.

Now that's to be distinguished from 'several' which is a usual indicator of more than, say, two or three. So to use the word 'several,' in an argument, is to imply, at least more than two.

So when an acquaintance of ours, name of , known to Block and recently given some Wiki admin. priviliges (AP) cites in his AP pleading:

He has been in dispute with several editors ... 

he's padding his case, since Blacketer full well knows that the only folks giving grief were:

Block
Blacketer

This came about because I started adding much more material to the Wiki entry on Natascha Engel and, in my innocence, I sidled-up to the Village Pump to seek advice on the substantiation of some of my contributions. I was particularly perplexed by the problem of my knowing certain facts through my personal correspondence with her.

Extensive source is available on the Talk page for the Engel article about what transpired next.

Well, anyway, Galloglass left the scene pretty quickly, so that left me contending with Block and Blacketer. Now correct me if I'm being stupid, but to me that leaves two. Then, mid-ocean Block jumps ship claiming a syndrome he named 'wikibonked' (I think - I've no idea what it means, but I think I'm getting to the stage where I may have caught a dose;-)

So that left one ... Blacketer. So 'one' is Blacketer's version of 'several.' And then you made him an administrator.

I've brought Blacketer to the stage since he's part of the same story of the 'double-standards' and 'hypocrisy' that I've discovered around here.

Oh, if you get a chance and want a cheap laugh, ask Blacketer what being a 'candidate' connotes ...

 YOU ARE BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY, YOU TRASHY DUSTBIN 

YOU ARE A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual  life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.

Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen. You are no where near a queen, but certainly are a huge ,filled with trash, dustbin. Pity you, unfortunate daft-LOSER- DUSTBIN. And the best last closing words to a daft dustbin like you are - FISH OFF.""",1,0,0,0,1,0

The third trine consists of the Tiger, Horse, and Dog. These three signs seek a true lover, and are like-minded in their pursuit of humanitarian causes.

Idealistic and impulsive, the Tiger, Horse and Dog follow the beat of their own drummer. Defiant against injustice, these three signs wilt without large amounts of physical affection and loyal support for causes. They are productive, enthusiastic, independent, engaging, dynamic and honourable. They can also be rash, rebellious, quarrelsome, hot-headed, reckless, anxious, moody, disagreeable, and stubborn. Although these three signs are loyal, they can be very protective when lied to.

So now we have the situation of some saying that some of the events in the life of Moses was taken from the Dionysius myth or vice versa. Now Moses probably did exist  and probably did lead the Israelites to the land of Canaan (now Israel), but him parting the red sea and floating around in the river Nile are a bit hard to believe. The most likely situation is that these events were taken from Orphic myths around about 5 th century BCE, when  the Exodus story  was written. The purpose was to give Moses mythic or supernatural credibility to add weight to the newly formed Hebrew religion.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The primary objective of Wikipedia?

A well collaborated group of 2 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related  new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. 

Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. 

All  redirects don’t  allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and  prevents recreating them under same name.

List of abusers  involved: 

user:Khoikhoi (sysop,) He has been probated and unprobated

 user:Aldux 
 user:Tekleni
 user:Telex
 user:NikoSilver 
 user:Euthymios

Thank you for putting that vandalism notice on 69.118.94.155's talkpage. This anon has done this countless times, won't listen to reason, and just vandalized my userpage . Please keep a close eye on him!   

Thank you for the block. He was being quite immature, there.   

 Iloveminun 

Thank you for reverting all of  Rainbow Sneakers 

I requested a check user, and I've found Po132 and Minun132 are the same person and Iloveminun and PokemonFan are the same person. What should I do now?  Rainbow Sneakers 

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 
Is there any particular way to do it? Or do I just note notarize the points and link to the evidence?  Rainbow Sneakers 

Done, you can find it here. Sorry for the wait, I'm feeling bad and Mailer Diablo and I were discussing FAC problems. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 

We did it! Thank you for all the help, I feel slightly embarrassed that someone who has been here a month in so much more knowledgable than I am in certain aspects. If you ever need a hand with something (Fair use, FAC, GA) just drop me a bell. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

 Blocking Mardyks  

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanists agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want.

The realtor site is a company that has been featured on the news for helping fraud victims.   They were recognized by NC State represenative Deborah Ross.    Considering most real estate companies are crooks, its good to highlight one that is not.

I just said that is recognized by WWE as a title. 2)If you see the animation on the Million Dollar Championship history page on WWE.com you will see that the title was abandoned after Ted DiBiase reign. Abandoned = retired.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67

84595,e256c705a5845908,"Link Building strategies 

Link building is the practice of getting other sites to link back to your website. This can often be done using a wide variety of strategies, such as:

Asking for a link
Giving away content or tools
Widget development
Social media campaigns
Purchasing links and more….
But first, let’s start with the basic theories…

* Why Link Building Matters

Whenever any user enters a query into a search engine, the search engine needs to determine how to return the best results. How? There are two key steps:
Figure out which pages on the web are related in any way to the query
Evaluate which of the pages that relate to the query are the most important
Each link to a web page is seen as a vote for that web page.
In simple terms, if there are two pages that are equally relevant to a given search query, the page with the better inbound link profile will rank higher than the other page (being all other factors equal).
Hence, the need of Link Building!

*How Search Engines Evaluate Links

Each link to a web page is a vote for that web page.
That implies the higher the PR, the more the value of that vote. This is partially true. But, two votes may not have equal weight even if they are from same PR page.
Value of vote depends on – Relevance and Authority
Now let’s take a deeper look at these factors…

Roy, good questions. Yes it's actual thrust data from the Columbia mission, STS-107. However you can't directly measure thrust. Rather it's calculated from other parameters such as chamber pressure. Also the thrust curve is generally corrected to constant sea level or constant vacuum thrust. In actuality the physical thrust would be constantly changing, even if engine thrust was constant (which it's not for the SRBs). I include below some more info I was preparing to post:

Because of the frequent confusion on this point, I uploaded a thrust/time graph for the SRBs. I also revised the thrust numbers in the article to reflect this. SRB sea level liftoff thrust is 2.8 million pounds each. Each SSME produces 393,000 pounds sea level thrust at 104% power level. Thus the shuttle total liftoff thrust is: (393,000 * 3) + (2,800,000 * 2) = 6.779 million pounds force, or 3.075 million kgf, or 30.16 MN. Using these numbers the SRBs provide 82.6% of liftoff thrust. 

This is confusing because many sources just blindly copy the 3.3 million pound thrust number, some even erroneously adding """"sea level"""" or """"liftoff"""" thrust. There are six possible thrust numbers for the SRB:

 Sea level liftoff thrust
 Sea level peak thrust
 Sea level average thrust
 Vacuum liftoff thrust
 Vacuum peak thrust
 Vacuum average thrust

The problem is most references don't state which they are using. This is why references state SRB thrust from 2.65 million lbs (probably sea level average thrust) to 3.4 million lbs (probably vacuum peak thrust).

When comparing SRB thrust to, say, Saturn V F-1 engine thrust, you must consider the different characteristics of each engine type. The F-1 is not throttlable, so excluding altitude variations always produces the same thrust. At sea level this is 1.5298 million lbs per engine or 7.649 million lbs thrust total. By comparision the SRB thrust changes over the burn time (see chart). Space shuttle total sea level liftoff thrust is 6.779 million pounds force, or about 88.6% of the Saturn V.

In theory you could compare the SRB thrust at T+20 sec which is somewhat higher, but that wouldn't be liftoff thrust.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Ebyabe made comments which appear to be reasonable at first glance, but are actually unreasonable because one is fraudulent and the other was untrue regarding a place where she could see that it was untrue.)  Well a sort-of reasonable comment anyway because he claims that I am being """"confrontational"""" when it is clearly visible at my talk page that other users are attacking me and not the other way around.  I have not caused any confrontation...   I have replied to other users who are putting a confrontation to me.  (I did ask how to report a user, but I did not actually report him because nobody answered regardless of several posts made, and the user himself did not comment there, so that was not a confrontation like it would have been if I'd been able to make the report.)  I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

63308,a9673dee41061eb9,"Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.

I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.

In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

One thing I'm wondering is what will this really accomplish? Are you asking for another 3 person decision?

That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race.

 Bog turtle 

Hello Mr. Malleus, it's been a while.  We are still pushing forth with the bog turtle article as the current school year draws to a close.  On the verge of submitting for FAC, I would like to have the article copy-edited by professional eyes one last time as per .  In short, I was hoping you would still be interested in helping some humble high school students!  

No need for the formalities, you can call me Malleus; it's not my real name, after all. -) When are you hoping to take this to FAC? I'm sure I'll be able to look it over in the next couple of days or so.  Fatuorum 

Well, I was hoping to put it to the critics fairly soon, however, we're having some intense discussion on the talk page...Any time in the next couple of days (i.e. spring break for me) will be just fine (p.s. the only reason for the """"Mr."""" is because I am myself just a minor -_-).

And then given that the claim is now scoped to just Bayless, it becomes a question of undue weight whether or not to include this particular anecdote. The book then claims that Bayless spoke of """"the impossibility of making Mexican food in restaurants"""", which, to me, indicates that Bayless is speaking from a position of culinary aesthetics rather than a practical evaluation of Mexican cuisine.

GTBacchus, that is an excellent idea. Indeed, the sources are available (as we have both noted) in the Dresden Firebombing Wikipaedia page, so there's no real dispute about their availability and relevance. The WP:RSs are there for editors to assess in the wiki-link provided.
I would have edited the main page myself, but I know from experience how territorial some editors are over their favourite pages and WP policy requires some degree of notification and consensus building before making signficant changes to an article. Given the sensitive nature of """"War Crimes"""", I imagine that every edit is controversial. When I raised this topic, I assumed that this (rather obvious) ground had been covered and, ironically, thought I would avoid treading on some toes by asking why the Dresden Firebombing wasn't in the main article, lol.

One good reason would be that it would be wrong, on procedural due process and substantive due process grounds.  Make that two good reasons.  Lionelt has reported 5 """"reverts,"""" none of which hold up to scrutiny.  First revert is actually changing a paraphrase of the source into a direct quote of the source, while eliminating references to primary sources (eg, I Corinthians) bolstering POV arguments of the editor, not relying on secondary sources. 2nd & 3rd """"reverts"""" are actually an accommedation to the removal of the citation of the primary source by moving the table displaying the primary sources including the Corinthians source in context in parallel columns [originally produced by me four years ago] higher in the article to allow readers to decide for themselves what the primary source said]. """"revert"""" 4 eliminate a redundancy in another New testament reference covered by the table as well as an unsourced claim and is not a reversion. """"revert"""" 5 is simply not a reversion, is an attempt to flesh out a paraphrase of a source, from the source, a point which I actually don't agree and it's not my point of view, nor I think the point of view of that person making the complaint.

In addition, the complainant is required to document his attempt to work it out on the talkpage which he has not done. You've tried to resolve this edit war on the article talk page, haven't you? So put a link to the discussion here. If all you've done is reverted-without-talk, you may find yourself facing a block too >
Diff of attempt to resolve dispute on article talk page: [diff]

My repeated attempts to get other editors to discuss content, talkpages have the perverse result of being used against me.  I used the term, editors, when there's really only one other editor, Esoglou, who is currently under sanction, and who used to be sanctioned under the handle LimA.  Lionelt's involvememnt stems from a cry for allies at the Christiannity noticeboard:
 Origin of the Eucharist 

History2007 has referred above to a past problem with the article Origin of the Eucharist.  The problem is again as acute as ever.  Only two editors are active in opposing the lone editor about whose apparent aims I say nothing.  I would be grateful if editors with greater knowledge than I have about Wikipedia rules would give advice.  One solution with which I am toying is to let the lone editor have free rein, so that nobody then reading the article would take it seriously.    

One thing I am not sure about is this. Does Eschoir have a possible WP:COI issue there? That may be one way to resolve it. As I said before, I have 1,500 pages on my watchlist, so I can not get involved in details there right now, and that is why we need a general 9-1-1 call system or a Mayday button (perhaps built into the WikiProject Christianity banner) as Lionel suggested so editors can be called for help.   
What an interesting idea: add it to the banner. Well, if you like the """"Click here in case of emergency"""" button I just added to the top of this talk page, it should be relatively easy to add the button to the banner. It would take a consensus, of course, and we'd want to coordinate with John's redesign of the banner. – Lionel (talk) 
Lionelt has helped very much, and I express my appreciation.  As for Eschoir, I think he just enjoys stirring others up.  In the past, another favourite target of his was Free Republic (see the archived talk pages).

The only """"major controversy"""" is that on this Wikipedia page, the denialists, such as Duesberg and his followers, those whose ramblings are linked out to from this page, and who have had their long-disputed and dismissed theories and misinformation floating around on he web for many years, were being used as the sole source of 'credible' information on the larger controversy around AIDS and poppers  until I happened upon it.  From the first edit I made, I was almost immeditely reversed, and edited.  Within hours of that first contribution, I was being threatened and censored.  Ultimately, I was blocked, charged with violating unknown-to-me 'rules' of Wikipedia, and otherwise censored, and rendered unable to contribute.  And, that, gentlemen, is what I've been complaining about for the past month here on Wikipedia.

It would be much better if the Wikipedians, with their vast experience of computer knowledge, particularly as it relates to being able to master Wikipedia, would stand aside and let those of us who actually have knowledge about the subject of nitrites and poppers make meaningful contributions to this page.

However, I suspect that will not be allowed to happen.  I say this based on my personal experience over the past month here, and based on the news accounts last month on CNN, ABC Nightly News, and elsewhere, which revealed that Wikipedia was being ruined by those who practice the same kind of censorhip and harrassment that I've been subjected to.

How Wikipedia policies/guidelines may apply to issue of Muhammad's pictures

Wikipedia:Profanity
Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.

Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:
 Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive
 Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.
 No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic
 As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.
 In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.

WP:NOT#CENSORED
This policy states:
 Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.
 Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.

Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?
Some users (Itaqallah and ALM) have suggested that since printing of Muhammad's images has , therefore Wikipedia too should not print the images otherwise it will be a violation of WP:UNDUE. Cartoon images of Muhammad have been printed all over the World and this is not likely to change now:

 List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons

Printing of images is no longer a minority tradition and so UNDUE does not apply.  (talk•contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

I think that Canada's military contributions to the British Empire in the latter part of the 1800s and very early 1900s are a good indication of increased autonomy. There may not have been any formal granting of such autonomy, but it was exercised. Desmond Morton in A Military History of Canada (McClelland & Stewart 1999, ISBN 0-7710-6514-0) describes how Canada refused a British request for troops to be sent to fight in Africa in the mid-1880s and the initial denial of troops to fight in the Second Boer War (internal pressures eventually resulted in Canadians fighting in this war). The reluctance of French Canada to support Imperial conflicts likely hastened Canada's movement towards greater autonomy.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North West Frontier Province by H.A Rose, IBBETSON, Maclagan (http://www.archive.org/stream/glossaryoftribes03rose#page/n5/mode/2up)

On Page 269, the author writes: """"Similarly, if the Ramdasias do not follow the occupation of Chamars, it is no reason to separate them from that castes. So if a Ramdasia is Julaha, that is a weaver, and if he is 'Bazzaz' that is a draper, his caste remains unchanged. If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives 'pahul' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias. The Ramdasias do receive the daughters in marriage of ordinary Chamars, but give them 'pahul' before associating with them"""".........""""The the Ramdasi is still a Chamar"""". 

On page 300, the author writes: """"The Sikh Chamar or Ramdasia. — It will be seen from Table VIII A that in the north and centre of the Eastern Plains a very considerable number of Chamiirs have embraced the Sikh religion. These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much higher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar. They are apparently as true Hindus as any Chamars can be, and are wrongly called Sikhs by confusion with the Ranidasias"""".

Ok, I've managed to load the reference, the website was apparently down earlier, and I've checked the equation. Oberth uses 'c' for the relative exhaust velocity (and slightly weirdly/elegantly) he uses a negative number for it; it's a different equation to yours. Oberth also takes the time to explain what it all means, whereas you've just plonked an equation down in the article.

If you copy his equation better, and fixed up the diagram to match, and explained what the symbols mean, and what the implications are, that would be OK for inclusion.  14:08",0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

I won't comment further on the book, as I think my comments below are sufficient.
Regarding the Web sites, I would note that there seems to be very few Web sites on Plasma Cosmology / Plasma Universe (unlike sites on Big Bang cosmology), and I think that is worth taking into account.
plasmacosmology.net
... appears to be generally OK to me. I see obvious areas of contention, with section on the Electric Universe, Ancient Testimony, and Speculations. But these pages are separate and obvious, and do not seem to """"pass off"""" the more speculative material as if it were pure Plasma Cosmology.
... the site certainly isn't peer reviewed, and it is unlikely to have been produced by an """"authority""""... the Contact page says """"Independent Researcher""""
... The site more closely resembles a """"blog"""" since it appears to be produced by one person, but that is not grounds for automatic dismissal. We already include a page from the Web site of Ned Wright,, and while he is obviously an authority on Big Bang cosmology, I would argue that he is not an authority on Plasma Cosmology. Nevertheless, I am sure he points out some errors in Eric Lerner's work, and I am sure that Lerner has pointed out misunderstandings in Wright's. Either way, there seems to be value in Wright and Lerner's pages (irrespective of whether we agree with their points of view). Likewsise, I think there is value in plasmacosmology.net, even though there may be disagreements with parts of it.
thunderbolts.info
I must declare a potential conflict of interest with the site, as I am shown as a contributor,, so I will refrain from commenting more, unless you specifically ask me to do so, now knowing the connection.
For similar reasons, I have not added my own Web site, plasma-universe.com, as a possible resource, even though I believe it offers a unique resource.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1,0,1,0,1,0

83435,df36cd3003f1a924,"Research shows that one of the most prominent characteristics of infant directed speech is the wider opening of the mouth that is present in those using infant directed speech versus adult directed speech.  This differences occurs especially in vowels.  Vocal pitch is also heightened during infant directed speech and research indicates vowels are spoken with the highest pitch when infant directed speech is used.  The horizontal positioning of the lips in infant directed speech does not differ significantly from positioning used in adult directed speech.  Instead, the only observed difference remains in vertical lip positioning.  By making the opening of the lips larger, infants are more likely to focus on the face of the speaker.  Research suggests that the larger the opening of the lips during infant directed speech, the better infants will understand the message being conveyed due to the additional visual cues available.  The intensity of speech, however, does not differ from that used in adult directed speech contrary to popular belief.   

Infant directed speech does not only include the characteristics of high pitched speech and elongated syllables, but also incorporates visual body movements that assist in conveying meaning of language to infants.  One monumental visual aspect of infant directed speech is the movement of the lips.  In addition, head movements are used to emphasize various syllables within language production.  These visual cues provide infants the additional information needed to perform accurate speech discrimination during language development.  Further, visual cues allow infants to discriminate speech differences in environments in which they cannot rely on their hearing, such as in noisy environments.  The auditory and visual aspects of infant directed speech do not exist independently, however.  Infants rely equally on both methods of understanding and as development continues, infants strengthen the link between these two important categories.  

It must be considered that although infant directed speech features marked characteristics, it may not only be these characteristics aiding in development of language for children.  Due to the visual cues used  by caregivers in this method of communication, infants are more highly motivated to engage in communication.  Because infants are willing to participate in this process, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of infant directed speech.  

It is often assumed that infants are interested in the properties of infant directed speech and play a passive role in this interaction.  However, research indicates that infants are not only attracted to the practice itself but to people who engage in infant directed speech.  Through this practice, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development.  When infants use infant directed speech as a determinant of acceptable caregivers their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants.",0,0,0,0,0,0

ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and

 Ununseptium (in some time) 

Hi, Double sharp. As you know, there's that At FAC going on at the moment, but, in some time, it will be over, and there's also that ununseptium article waiting for the spotlight. I came to ask some help from you with that, I hope it won't be too difficult for you (it shouldn't be, but there may also be those RL issues, that's why I'm asking some time before I could actually start).

I think the article is great. It was a FAC in 2012, but it was failed due to prose quality. It's, however, not 2012 now, and some work will be required. I would love you to help me check things against accessibility. I was writing that article with non-technical readers in mind (and it actually turned out to be among the easiest to do so among all superheavies). I don't really expect to get that """"oh, wow, I knew nothing, but now I seem to get it"""" from all readers, but I want it to be at least a stable """"well, it's not easy, but I seem to get it."""" I think History and Naming are fine, and so is Nuclear stability, but those last two subsections need some look at; some examples of what I want to improve are """"the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p5"""" (because what does that mean? We need to explain it) and """"1.67 D"""" (we say it's a """"relatively small"""" value, but how small, really? Some examples should help a little bit). And also, maybe you've seen some superheavies predictions since then?

I will also check the data available. Wil think how to merge the German experiment into the story (I actually love the story of the discovery the way I wrote it). In the end, will ask for a thorough copyedit.

But that will happen later. Again, the start is not scheduled for tomorrow. What do you think, could you help me with that?  

Sure, I'll help you! I remember how you wrote the discovery: it was really neat. I haven't gone looking for new superheavy predictions in a while, but I'll go looking for them and I'll see what I can come up with.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unless nobody presents reliable sources that Yugoslav Politburo had nothing to do with this policy the removed assertion should be returned to the text of the article.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please don't revert correct information as you did to Bath School disaster. The number in the article matches the reference cited plus the sentence says the number INCLUDES his wife. I put 44 to replace 43 because that is what that section represents. Also, if you notice in the info box of the list of deaths, it numbers 45 and that is not including the killer who commmited suicide. So 44 is accurate ONLY in the section cited. The number 43 is wrong any way you put it. I know it was the deadliest. How does me adding one person to the total in the section where it was incorrect (43) to my correction to 44 make it less deadlier? It makes it more accurate, right?

Similarity to """"Boy Kings""""
Section on similarity between this book and The Boy Kings was deleted. The facts in question are easily verified. What was the reason for this deletion?
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Re: the two flags: on notability, the book has received substantial media attention. See, for example, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323342404579081503189753492.html

In addition, the author himself is critically acclaimed (see his page).

On sources, Amazon is a credible source for the topic in question, the relative contents of two books. The Twitter sources are necessary given that 1. Twitter is the topic being discussed (specifically: discussions on Twitter about the book), and 2. the issue is new and has not yet been written about in mainstream publications. These sources can be improved as additional information and media coverage becomes available which is likely given the high profile of the author, the ongoing media attention to the book, and the fact that The Circle will soon be released.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

If it's easily verified, it shouldn't be hard to find secondary sources to support it.   

Agreed, that is a fair point, though it will only be easy to do so if sufficient time has passed for secondary sources to pick up on it which they haven't yet. It was only a matter of hours ago that the alleged victim of plagiarism was made aware of the details of the book in question (The Circle) and therefore able to point out the similarities. In the coming days it is likely to receive more attention. The female author in question has upward of 1,500 Twitter followers and a well-received book on Amazon and the other comments on Twitter corroborating her interpretation also come from prominent Tweeters. While I am a Wikipedia novice, it does not seem that this is an unusually suspect story to report in somewhat-real-time versus other pages that are rapidly updated, and to reiterate, it is very obvious from reading the respective Amazon pages that there are myriad similarities between the books and it is only a matter of time before this is picked up.
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

Update: a secondary source is now available. Updating accordingly. 
68.3.130.42  noviceuser

I see your edit was removed by a bot. I don't think it's impossible that there might surface secondary sources to support this part of the article, but these aren't them. Tweets are generally considered unsuitable, which is why bots remove them. And that Medium post isn't a suitable source either. 1) it's written by the person who is theoretically the aggrieved party in this case, 2) Medium is basically a self-publishing platform, like Livejournal, and doesn't really qualify as a secondary source, especially in the case of a potentially contentious allegation like this.   

Let's not let this plagiarism flap stand in the way of making this a better article.  It could use a lot of improvement.  My personal opinion is that the plagiarism claim (which amounts to """"I wrote a book about a woman hired by a social networking firm, and any similar books are plagiarism"""") should not be included in the article anyway, in the absence of a lawsuit or settlement.  So let's get some interesting stuff about the book in there.  For one thing, Margaret Atwood reviewed the book at length. 70.114.146.227  Eric""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello,

there was no Ugodski-Zavod raion in tsarist era, I was wrong, sorry. The tsarist-era raion was
of larger scale than later soviet-era raion. 
- therefore is right: """"born in ...Maloyaroslavets raion"""".

There is a lot of junk published by big publishers today. The only difference is that the BIG CORPORATE JUNK has few typographical and grammatical errors.  But the key issue here is: Will the reader who wants to know more about me find it in my books? Obviousy yes. Furthermore there are writings of other people in my books and there are photocopies of important documents like letters from Cap Weinberger on DOD stationary, letter from Bootsie Galbraith wife of US Ambassador to France at the time on official stationary, documents from the late CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman - who BTW was the model for and wrote some of the episodes for the TV Series """"The Enforcer"""".

Hello Rigadoun, your query raises a puzzle for which I would welcome your input.

I'm sure we agree that editing without a reference source is a terrible idea, and articles should have lots and lots of in-line references to indicate where all the material came from.

But what if all the material comes from one single reference source?  In such a case, I could, in principle, add a footnote to every sentence, which would cite the very same source.  But this seems a little bit inelegant and reader-unfriendly to me.  I felt it better simply to declare, once and for all, that everything in the article came from the same source.  Yours sincerely,   

Josef Friedrich Anton Fleischmann

Hi. I see you have just changed Johann to Josef. However Grove gives Johann. Why did you put Josef? In fact I have asked an admin to change it to Friedrich Fleischmann - which is apparently the usual short form - and the one the German version uses. Best.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I remember reading about a DKW racing motorcycle engine with three cylinders but one combustion chamber.  In essence, the two outside cylinders were mounted vertically and formed a Twingle or split-single unit, while the middle cylinder was mounted horizontally (facing forward in the frame), had a larger bore and a smaller stroke, and was essentially a supercharger for the other cylinders.

Does anyone have any documentation for this engine?  I think the motorcycles it powered were successful racers at the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0

< !  >
No problem, and I think many people appreciate a user saying """"job well done.""""  The commenting feature of HTML (the bracket exclamation point business) makes text invisible.  For instance, if you were to look at """"edit this page"""" you could see a sentence here: .   This is occasionally done in articles for a variety of reasons:
Put in a notice about vandalism (such as is done on Chuck Norris, which is also, at present, semi-protected), or when the same mistake is made by many users,
Automated bots sometimes also """"remove"""" an image by enclosing it in comments, when the image may be added incorrectly.
In rare cases, text additions are put in comments so that other editors can see them, before the material is added to the article properly.  This is usually a bad use of the comments, since it makes things confusing to edit.
They often appear at the end of semi-automated template messages, to indicate which message was used (that is where the """"Template:Unsigned"""").  So, for instance, I wrote {{subst:unsigned|00 tux}}, and the unsigned template was added.  If you want to try out some templates (which are always enclosed in two curly-braces) in the Wikipedia:Sandbox, a pretty good list of common template messages is available at WP:TM.

Hi Codman. We have been through this before. Making highly emotive and subjective remarks in article is not appropriate for wikipedia.

I don't disagree with any of the points you are making but I will continue to tone down emotive remarks and remove opinions as they have no place here.

If you have facts then cite them. Commenting on research then saying 'therefore we must' is not encylopedic, it is your (probably correct) opinion. Saying something is criminally inadequate is rubbish as otherwise where are the legal proceedings?

Hi! Thank you so much for weighing it at the CFD on acussations of Piracy. Could you please apply your experience and helps us editors weed through two issues at Sea Shepherd Conservation Society? 1. When is it appropriate to put an organization's wiki article into category Eco-terrorism? Do we need notable experts to say they are EC? Do we need courts to say EC? Do we look at FBI definition of EC and apply it liberally? Do we never put an org there? 2. When is it appropriate to place ArticleX in category 1 vs. CatArticleX in category 1? For instance, if category Eco-terrorism is appropriate for article SSCS, and if category Eco-terrorism is appropriate for category SSCS how do we determine which one to use? Some editors want it to be visible, some editors want it to be less visible. Can you please give us some wisdom on the talk page of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society?

If I may answer for Nancy (she should feel free to correct me), such a summary will be accused of being apologetic.  I saw it at earlier FACs where a significant number of editors thought there was not enough coverage of this issue.  """"This is a big deal! There is not enough coverage. Censorship!""""  (One may note such sentiments are not wholly absent from this talk page either.) I read it as recentism as well as the whipping-boy status the Church has in certain circles of western media.  I sympathize with Nancy and others that such a concise formulation would be a target at FA and an obstacle to achieving FA status.

I could ask this on the project talk page, but I'm probably just misisng a few obvious things. Please let me know your thoughts on these:
 Via the AFC category pages, I've encountered a number of articles where the template states that they are NOT under review at this time. Is that a bug? I felt like it was wasting my time.
 Similarly, a few that had already been declined.
 I'm pretty """"up"""" on WP policies (I've done thousands of edits, created a few articles myself, participated in consensus building and admin-assisted special ops, etc.). However, I'm finding it hard to deal with the Gnn reason codes and WikiProject templates. Any advice? Is this something that should really be in the script?
 What do we do with Sandbox entries that the author obviously never wanted reviewed, even though they are in a review status? I'm not sure how they got there to begin with. For example, I saw a page that was obviously intended to the User main page, once he got his broken English repaired, and it was far from complete, yet it somehow had come into AfC. Really don't know how. Any idea how it got to us? Or what to do about any such article in review?
I did approve one article, but I'm not sure I did two things correctly for it. a) I did some minor, obvious content cleanup (extraneous headings on a stub, hide TOC on stub, move infobox to top). b) I saw some obvious connections to other stubs on the same subject (a book series). AFter I approved it, I edited the automatic message on the user's talk page and added some suggestions to create a comprehensive book list for the series and possibly to merge all the short articles into a single larger one. Were these two actions god, bad, or indifferent?

If you think these questions belon in the project talk page, fel free. Honestly, I think this project is begging for a new-reviewer-FAQ. And maybe some screen-shot tutorial.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dear Mr.Slrubenstein. Your point about NOR and verifiable sources is well taken. Accordingly I am providing an official Government of India biography of Ram Mohan Roy from the Press & Information Ministry of India which claims that Roy studied Judaism (in addition to other religions). The URL is http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fmay2002/f020520021.html . I do not know if you will recognise this because this same government for many years did not recognise the State (country) of Israel. Of course this only states that Roy """"studied"""" Judaism and is not conclusive proof that Brahmoism was influenced by Judaism. However, we find significant similarities between the Brahmo Dharma beej of 1850 and some tenets of Judaism such as Maimonides. You will appreciate that these issues are unproveable and matters of faith and I do not doubt yours. Likewise, I leave it up to you to do the right thing. Brahmos are highly unlikely to claim that they are Jews (of any kind) or distort / vandalise your religion/faith. My Brahmo religion specifically prohibits reviling or disparaging other faiths whilst emphasising strengthening the bonds between *men* of different faiths. I personally have not known many Jews (Judaists) as there are so few in India, I was lucky to have a learned tutor - his name was Ezra - he had a PhD and attended synagogue and I learnt many things from him besides Mathematics. I respect your wishes to scrutinise all the other faiths which claim to have been influenced by Judaism. Sincerely.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've extended your block to a week, because I think 24 hours is too lenient here.

Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block.

Is there a WP policy on this type of situation, or a precedent for other women who have changed their names from their birth names to something else but not as a result of marriage? Thanks!

This is the point where the nonmuslims invite the wrath of All muslims

Nonmuslim nations are weaping about terrorism and they are giving wind to the fire in muslim hearts burnt due to these type of PICTURES displayed on the sacred Artical of Muhammad (PBUH). The day is near when muslims will take revenge. From the history we have seen that ARABS and NONARABS have slayed their children in the name of ALLAH nad MUHAMMAD. So if the writer of this artical MUHAMMAD and the pictures includer thinks that he is giving a good idea of getting knowledge, he/she is obviously on wrong path. Respect to get Respect, more over LIVE AND LET LIVE (basic peaceful Muslims psycology). There is a need of education among Nonmuslim nations especially cristians who have no path to live, in tension they are running here and there to get shelter but, let us see in next 2 decades they are building such a mountain for them which they cant handle. THE Discussion is to long and i have lot more points, i dont want any one to opt the orders but to """"DO LISTEN"""" and think a way out.

SO PLEASE DO NOT CREAT PROBLEMS FOR YOUR SELF. """"IF NATIONS LIKE ARAB SOUTH ASIA WILL COME TO KNOW ABOUT THESE PICTURES ABOUT WHICH MOST OF MUSLIMS ARE UNAWARE THERE WILL BE A VERY BIG PROBLEM"""".

If USA, Allies want Pakistan to become what they think then make islam happy Pakistan will get into there clutch. more over the point to restore peace in AFGANISTAN AND IRAG the common man in pakistan is more intelligent than the think tank in USA. since i have been to lot more places i think that policy needs to be completely revived i dont want the powerful nation to enforce a world wide civil wars and revolutions. In Muslims there is nothing except Faith in ISLAM. They always unite in time of need and the internal hot talk in every streat of pakitan is integration of all the sects and nations named muslim

looking forward in anitcipation.

Remove these Pictures and become safe please do not get on to the war and kill and get Killed in the hand of muslims and let us become your friends.Muslims have Faith in JIHAD nonmuslims has no term like that as basic piller of religion. One way what i propose is very safe...

 What Makes a Person Notable? 

After deleting the listing of Hardy Parkerson from the listing of Longview's """"Notable People"""" and giving my reasons, the name was re-listed. To be fair, if Mr. Parkerson believes himself or if some one who knows him believes him to be a person who has notoriety because of his connection in Longview, I am willing to let the reader decide.  I do not dispute that Mr. Parkerson is notable for various reasons.  He is known for his poetic ditty's and short rhyming verses.  He is also known very well in Louisiana as an attorney where he practiced for some 40 years.  He has supporters and admirers who may well consider him """"famous"""" as well as detractors who consider him """"infamous"""".  He did not go quietly into the night when he resigned the Louisiana bar and retired from the practice of law.  

However, since Mr. Parkerson has lived and worked in Lake Charles, Louisiana since before he graduated from high school; and since he has not done anything significant or notable in his life that has been connected to his early years in Longview; and, since he is not recognized or known by any but a very few people in Longview, it is therefore fair to question his listing as a notable person from Longview.  Unlike others """"Notable People"""" listed in the Longview Texas article, very few references can be found regarding Mr. Parkerson's Longview roots.  (this contributor found only one on the Internet after extensive search). In fact, it is Lake Charles that is referenced as Mr. Parkerson's home. By comparison, in the other's listings their place of birth as Longview Texas is mentioned in almost every reference of their name. 

Mr. Parkerson was born in Longview.  He lived in White Oak (not Longview) until he was 12, (according to records found on the internet).  He moved to Nacogdoches, Texas and at some time moved again to Lake Charles, Louisiana where he graduated from high school.  Since then there is little if any record of his interaction with """"his home town.""""  As I said before, he needs to be satisfied to be a notable person from Lake Charles and Louisiana.

Therefore, if he is to be listed, and because he is not well known, some background needs to be given so that the reader will have a better understanding of Mr. Parkerson's connection to Longview. A short bio and the circumstances which led to his resignation and all should be made available to those who read his name in the list.  Otherwise he should be satisfied with his legacy in Louisiana, for he has none of note here.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dec 30 - Israel attacks Gaza for the fourth day - http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=54699 (from the BBC)

On goals(aim) - """"Israel's defence chief earlier said his country was fighting a """"war to the bitter end"""" against Hamas.""""

On whether to use 'stated' or not - """"Israel says its aim is to end the rocket attacks by Hamas-linked militants - of which there were reportedly more than 40 on Monday.""""

Dec 27 - Israel's attack on Gaza kills hundreds - http://www.contracostatimes.com/california/ci_11323391

On goals - """"The government said the open-ended campaign was aimed at stopping rocket attacks that have traumatized southern Israel.""""

""""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said late Saturday that the goal was """"to bring about a fundamental improvement in the security situation."""" He added, """"It could take some time.""""

""""Stated""""? - see above plus """"Israel warned it might go after Hamas' leaders, and militants kept pelting Israel with rockets - killing at least one Israeli and wounding six.

Dec 30 - Israel Assaults Hamas In Gaza - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/27/israel-launches-air-strik_n_153664.html

On goals - """"Israel's stated goal is to cripple Hamas' ability to launch rockets at Israeli towns, which means that a ground invasion is becoming more likely as it becomes clear that airstrikes alone cannot finish the job.""""

""""Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has declared """"all-out war against Hamas.""""

""""Stated""""? Yes. But infrastructure? and since Hamas fire those rockets from civilians area, not having military bases of their own, police stations and houses in gaza are Hamas' infrastructures?

I recognized Nishidani's point as being that from the beginning there was ambiguity as to what this Israel's attack was to bring Israel itself. Now there was a target inside Gaza, Hamas, there is war, but is war about what? goals? yes to some degree, but most of those goals can't be archived until conquering has been archived(re:Iraq war, AND Israel's previous occupations of both Lebanon and Palestine)...so to cripple Gaza, only Hamas's """"infrastructure"""" was the """"stated"""" goal?

At what point, even Israel's foreign minister was at odds with what the prime minister was """"stating"""" as the goals for this operation.

Needless to say then, it would be a great disservice if we use Israel's """"stated goals"""" as of Jan 30.

My humble suggestion is to leave it as """"The operation was aimed at..."""" Stated is a loaded term.

There should be even more discussion on this BTW. Cryptonio (talk) 

Plus, Dec 30 - ANALYSIS / Hamas is hoping for an IDF ground operation in Gaza - http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1051024.html

On goals - """"The operation's goals, as defined by the cabinet, are """"creating a different long-term security situation in the south, while bolstering Israel's deterrence."""" The IDF does not interpret this to mean a complete end to the rocket fire, as it considers this impossible. Rather, its goal is to eliminate Hamas' desire to attack Israel. The bombing campaign has so far dealt a severe blow to Hamas.""""

Fire in the hole. Notice ref to """"as defined""""(so they are defining what they are stating? or vice-versa?) plus IDF does not interpret what's been stated(which of course was defined before it was stated) which at the end, they disregard what was stated for them(perhaps rather just defined, in order for them to interpret on their own?) because they found what was 'defined' for them impossible(or what they interpreted as being defined to them).

Here, Toby72 asked me to take a look at this. Here is what I saw in a not-so quick look at recent edits.
This 14 April version of the article had an initial paragraph in the Colonia Era section which was largely unsupported.
In this 15 April edit, Toby72 replaced this paragraph with new content, still largely unsupported. The new content changed the focus of the paragraph, removing a heavy weight previously given to rape in a master/slave relationship in favor of heavier emphasis on mulatto offspring.
In this series of three April 15 edits, DD2K reintroduced the emphasis on rape, citing supporting sources.
In this 15 April edit, Tobby72 reverted the DD2K edits, saying """"WP is not a blog"""".
In this 17 April edit, Tobby72 added and rearranged some material.
In this 17 April edit, anon 69.105.28.149 reverted the article back to its state as of the last edit by DD2K, without explanation.
In this edit, apparently not noticing that the article had been anonymously reverted to one of his prevvious edit versions, DD2K made some further edits to the article, saying, """"Undid revision 550678046 by Tobby72 (talk)Not weighted properly. Vast majority of scholars(and obvious common sense) state slave/master 'relationsips' were rape by the very nature"""".
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added and removed some material in this and other sections of the article. saying, """"readd quotes per WP:NPOV, plus add pics"""".
In this May 3 edit, DD2k reverted the prior edit by Tobby72, saying, """"...  rv- stop- If you want to make these kinds of controversial changes, use the Talk page.""""
In this May 3 edit, Toby72 added a  tag to the section.

I think I've got that straignt. Some of the edits mentioned above were separated from one another by unrelated edits made by other users.

Guys, please re-read WP:BRD. I know that it is an essay and not a policy, but it does describe a workable method for reaching consensus by identifying objections to edits and keeping discussion moving forward and help towards breaking deadlocks. That Bold-Revert-Discuss method is much superior to the Bold-Revert-Unrevert-Edit war method which has been tried here. Regardless of how the section at issue got to be in its current state, can we please have some discussion aimed at establishing a consensus about what it ought to contain?

It looks to me as if the main area of disagreement is how much weight should be given to information about master-slave rapes in colonial America in an article on the topic of Mulatto, which the lead sentence describes as, """"a term commonly used in the United States to refer to a person who is born from one white parent and one black parent, or more broadly, a person of any 'mixed' ancestry."""" Input from editors not involved in the edit-warish exchanges above would probably be useful. I'll mention that this source might be useful. It speaks somewhat to the subtopic at issue here, though not from an American Colonial Era viewpoint.   (talk) (earlier Boracay Bill) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Hi Diza, re: your edit on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis I just wanted to let you know that this is a discussion that's been had before. The logic in calling it """"fatal"""" is that for the vast, vast majority of patients it is unfortunately a rapidly progressive disease. Although about 5% or so survive past 10 years most do not. I would certainly agree that primary lateral sclerosis or even progressive muscular atrophy could be considered chronic rather than fatal, although the latter is also life-limiting. As a counter-example I would say Parkinson's disease is chronic rather than fatal, even though statistically people with the disease do live for a shorter time than those who do not have it.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1,0,1,0,1,0

Might that be the reason the state eventually took that style and continued in that fashion?

From this distance one of the striking features of the commonwealth is the presence of the FSF HQ there, and another is that recently it was the least craven state WRT Microsoft.  The liberal tradition is remarked upon.

-What needs to be established here is if the few sources that are 'against the grain' and are highly critical of the efficacy of manipulation are noteworthy or simply represent a WP:FRINGE view. IMO, Ernst & Podsanski are the only 2 authors who make bold statements about manipulation, such as 'not effective', whereas the bulk of sources suggest equivalency with usual medical care and other conservative options. Thus, I see Ernst & Podsanski as outliers, or fringe, with regard to this specific topic of manipulation for back pain. Even source #4, which you noted says equal to sham, still suggests equivalency with other therapies for back pain, including usual medical care. 
-Doc James, you seem to want to omit the common finding by multiple high-quality sources that manipulation is equivalent to usual medical care and physiotherapy for back pain? Doesn't policy indicate that the majority view gets more weight? Which theme has more weight among the available secondary sources? 1) That manipulation is not effective for back pain or 2) that manipulation is equal to 'usual medical care' for back pain? I think that we will need to decide how much weight each idea should get....hopefully this RFC will help.

 Some notes 

Hi Amoruso, in regards to your edits on Palestinian refugee and Palestinian exodus, I want to ask you for a favor. While I don't agree that Katz is as neutral a source as you claim, I'm usually not one to advocate censorship on Wikipedia. However, you could do us a huge favor by trying to make your point (i.e. showing your sourced POV that you want to convey) without endless quotes from one rather biased source. The problem I have is that you are bombarding these articles with an endless tirade of anti-Palestinian quotes that, intentionally or not, turn the article into a hate blog. Again, while I admit I don't agree with your analysis as I think its a distortion of history and a sort of dehumanization, I am NOT asking you to remove it. What I am asking is that you make your point concisely, neutrally, (i.e. provide the point of view in a neutral way, if that makes sense), and in an encyclopedic manner. Endless quotes and tirades like that are not encyclopedic material. There are much better, proper, and neutral ways to make your point. Thanks  (talk) 

p.s. I noticed a new article Western Wall Tunnel in which you used a Haaretz article by Akiva Eldar as proof that Arafat 'incited' riots. That article says nothing of the sort, and barely mentions the tunnel incident just in passing as 'evidence' that Arafat was trying to get out of a dead end.

  The BLPN thread begins with this from you
After reverting an addition of a name of a living person to this article based on doubtful reasoning and subsequently the name being re-added, I am concerned about the basis of the whole article. There is an assumption that someone who is alleged to have had sex with a """"novice"""" or """"student"""" or """"disciple"""" (without unambiguous definitions of these terms) is fair game to be listed in this article as a """"sex abuse case"""". Some of the names listed have had no legal proceedings taken against them, others have been reported as having reached out of court settlements without the case being proven. There are obvious issues with the name of the article, the selection criteria for names being added and confusion about how well such cases need to be sourced. Fæ (talk) 
 However you spin it, it was you who initiated this process and you did not extend me the courtesy of informing me. I did not revert any deletion of yours in your account name unless it was an IP deletion or from another account and for each reversion I made I noted in the edit summary that I had referred to it  on the talk page and there gave my reasons and asked for dialogue.
 If I had seen your concerns I would have noted first of all that unambiguous definition of terms is not common in discourses and in any case I began the article with a clear description of what was meant by  'abuse' in the context of the article. Even in the drafting of legislation where great care is taken to be unambiguous there is nevertheless a need to leave some terms undefined: for example 'nation' in EU leglislation, 'indecent' in UK criminal legislation (in the context of child protection) - the examples are legion. In any case it is perfectly well understood what abusive sexual behaviour amounts to and abusive behaviour need not be criminal. In particular teacher-student sexual relationships are universally regarded as abusive on the part of the teacher. The selection criteria was mentioned in the article - that the individuals involved had founded Buddhist groups at the forefront of the emerging Western Buddhist movement.

For example, several of the aphorisms make explicit references to Horary astrology, which is not something that Ptolemy addressed at all in the Tetrabiblos.  One of the reasons for this, among others, is that interrogational astrology (ie. horary) was not developed until the 2nd and 3rd centuries and this development occurred in India within the Hindu tradition. (See Pingree, 1996, pg. 21)  Horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of Hellenistic astrology from which Ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on, and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the Middle Ages when the various Arab and Persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the Indian, Persian and Hellenistic traditions.

It reminds me of Orange County of the 1960s/70s and San Fernando valley of the 1940s/50s. Not since the mid 1980s has California had an economic worth before the recessions of 1988-1996 had been the worst on state record. The major cities and Indio-Coachella was the most affected by the recessions, and business money avoided them for awhile. Today, the money went to the lowest housing cost areas and the Inland Empire remains the best real estate deal in the state and nation as the average home price is in the $400s. Orange County and San Diego costs twice, Los Angeles thrice, and anyone moving to Victorville and Coachella will pay a quarter of the state average home price.

The thing about wikipedia that is magical is that we are a community of equals.  When someone (like User:Crossmr) unilaterally deletes a large swath of content against the stated objections of a number of contributors, it does dishonor to this equality.  When someone (like User:Crossmr or User:Scobell302) uses a threat of authoritarian action to prove that they are right, it does dishonor to this equality.  If you want to prove you are right, use the rights of all wikipedians (like User:Michaelas10 and User:Richard Harvey): EDIT!

Hell, when someone like User:74.129.234.170 tells you you're an asshole for being an asshole (or, in the words of a more tactful wikipedian, """"too bold""""), am I contributing to wikipedia?  No, probably not.  But am I honoring the spirit of equality?  Hell yeah!  We can swear at eachother until the cows come home without one of us depriving the other of the powers inherent in a wiki.  But if I wanted to contribute to an encyclopedia run by a community of rule-obsessed elites, I would submit to Encyclopedia Britannica.

Or, look at it from the utilitarian perspective.  I once tried to get in a revert war, and I found it was way too boring after only two rounds, so I quit (allowing User:Crossmr to get the last word...until a third party emerged from the community of equals to take my place).  But, man, throwing sand in the face of a pointless authoritarian?  Priceless!  I'll do it forever if you're willing to keep playing.  Bring it on!

Suffice it to say, I have a wikipedia alter ego, which has a couple serious contributions under his belt.  Or, to put it another way, I have a lot of IP addresses.

Convince, threaten, block.  Don't threaten, threaten, threaten.  It just doesn't work.

So if you want to revert my work, go for it.  I might argue with you, I might even be uncivil, but you can be certain that I won't block you or delete your contributions or even vandalize your encyclopedic content.  You won't find any proudly-displayed thank you notes from administrators on User_talk:74.129.234.170.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).

The focus of the animation is the CMYK model, which is a mathematical abstraction, and not the device dependency of any particular print process. I consider it helpful in the same way as the animations at the articles RGB color space and YCbCr are in explaining a 3-D volume that can be difficult to visualize from a static drawing.
 We cannot show subtractive ink colors accurately but that does not mean the article cannot have diagrams. The colors I used are the same as here and here i.e. 125 colors uniformly filling the displayable range and mapped to the CMK space. Note: this is not perfect, there is no gamma correction and linearity is assumed. If anyone likes to propose a different colour law in terms of 24-bit RGB shades, I can see about putting them in the animation.
 Just noticing that it is a spinning object tells the viewer it is something in 3-D. It helps to notice that the cube rotates about its diagonal which is the K axis. Then one understands the geometry.
 The goal is to give a qualitative visualization of how ink densities are coordinated like dimensions of a space. a) In principle three inks can define the whole gamut which is therefore a cube. The article explains that black ink is added to """"save money on ink"""" and to address the inadequacy of affordable CMK inks in very dark tones.

I think it is a forlorn expectation that any Wikipedia diagram can provide colorimetrically accurate color swatches. It is correct to show that the CMK trio of subtractive inks work, to a good first approximation, as orthogonal variables that define a color space.

jacobolus has ideas for further geometric diagrams of the printing process that should be helpful if they are based on reliable sources. May we hear more?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 

Hey there! I created an article for Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 and I was wondering if you could help me out by verifying the translations of the rules I made from a document posted on LTV's website . I noticed on your user page that you have written that you are fluent in Latvian so if you have the time I would appreciate your help! My main concern is that I believe they wrote that they will select ten artists and songs to compete in this national final, but during their description of the shows, I'm not sure I understood how they will select only four entries for the final during the preceding shows.   
I haven't spoken/read/written Latvian (I mostly spoke Czech at home even when I lived in Latvia) in a pretty long time so I'm a bit rusty, so don't hold it against me if I misinterpreted, but here's what I got out of the rules. The first semi-final is non-elimination and just supposed to introduce the songs to the audience. In the second and third semi-finals, two songs are eliminated in each show,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Nobody asked my opinion, but I'd like to mention two points that might be of use. A Rwandan academic I once knew told us that in his country, female circumcision consisted in exposing the clitoris by incising the clitoral prepuce to make it more accessible for hygiene AND for masturbation. Nowhere in the main article and its classifications of FMG types to I find any reference to that. The practice is combined in Type I along with removal of the clitoris.

My second point is that the notion that women are often stronger proponents of FGM than men seems to me to be a dangerous one, because it seems to me that it misses an essential point: that in patriarchal societies, women often, and even systematically, collaborate with the male-dominated power structure.

A third point, at no extra charge: Male circumcision is definitely mutilation, especially if incision of the clitoral prepuce alone is.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedia’s anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this.",1,0,0,0,1,0

I deleted all you message without reading. you are a sick and a cruel person. I would not like to see you ever again at my talk page.  
 Don't worry if you don't want to, you won't see me. Now, what you will keep seen is the problems that you do have. You got into them and are still in them since months ago. Am I not right? And there is a subtle mistake that you are making when addressing them. Curious about what it is? I will be here. Sick and cruel maybe but that is only a manifestation of being plain and true, no fictitious colors, no hidden things. Good luck with your holy war.   
OMG, how didn't I guess before. I know who you are. You left as  Dr. Jekyll, and you came back few days later as Mr. Hyde. You're really, really sick. You need to get some help. I feel sorry for you.  
 Is it really me who is sick? Maybe. Sort of a different illness as your, fortunately. Anyway, you don't want to look to what I am saying, no point to so much chitchatting. If you can really name my illnesses do so. It is useful and I don't mind.   
If you'd like to get a response at the message you left at Alison talk page, please remove it from there and re-post to you own talk page. As you rightly said Alison has nothing to do with the message that was addressed to me, and her talk page should be left alone.  
I asked you to delete it from Alison's talk page, you only copied it. Please delete it, it does not belong there, and we'll talk,  
 Well, it does belong there. It is not only a message to you, it is also a message to the other two that were there. Why would I post it there if not because it completes a story only said in half? I said to continue here because the rest seems to be going to be about me. But notice the text there hints the readers here so that if they want to read more they know here to come. If I delete that paragraph there, not only info is lost there, but also nothing links to the continuation here.

You are being a bit paranoid as you were when I reviewed one of your pictures in the most impersonal and objective way, as I always try to do. I just happens that among the things that I see, I support those that I think are right. No matter what. When I saw people doing wrong to you I condemned it. If I see you doing wrong I tell you.

About religious zealots attempting to delete the truth

Despite your delirious notions that homosexuality is a """"disease"""" to be """"cured"""", the fact of the matter is that it isn't and it can't be, the more scientific studies are done on the subject, the more your lies disintegrate when exposed to the daylight.

Anyway, if you could please not resort to your usual behavior towards the truth, which is usually trying to delete it when it doesn't serve your purpose, I would appreciate it.

Anyway, the reason I reverted CC80's edit is because this is a section devoted towards """"Behavior modification"""", I really don't see how it's """"unbalanced"""", it mentions the techniques that have been tried (and failed) to """"cure"""" a """"disease"""" that doesn't exist, and I cited it properly with respected organizations, such as the APA.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0

Increasingly concerned this article misrepresents bondeson's book
Whatever Bondeson's credentials, i think the central claim of this article (that upon """"Hitler's orders"""" superdog members of the SS were being sought), founded solely on a book by Bondeson that none of us has read, is probably false. In this BBC article http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13568270 Bondeson complains """"A rise in schools of animal psychology in the 1930s was encouraged by the Nazis, and Hitler in particular, and their potential military use examined. But that's a million miles away from the press claims - which get taller by the day - that the Nazis had a legion of talking, machine-gun-toting hounds, on the point of being unleashed on the allies."""" At any rate, I'm not sure any of this article should be taken seriously until someone actually reads the book (the only source for the material) rather than second hand, apparent misreadings (according to Bondeson in the BBC article) by the likes of The Sun. Do wikipedia articles about books get routinely written without the book having been read?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm being subject to harassment by two administrators, User:Slimvirgin and User:Jayjg (among other users), who object to my editing and are trying to drive me off the Wikipedia with persistent interference, factitious objections and POV censorship. After trying (and failing) to set me up under 3RR, they are now accusing me of """"disruption"""" and threatening me with a ban because I have objected to their harassment. Among their complaints is that I have been """"uncivil"""".

Hi Excirial.
First, I want to say thank you, for your time. And Happy New Year! I've made some changes on my article and I want to know if they meet the guidelines regarding Reliable Sources.
Kind regards, Zoe.
  

 Hello there Zoepe,

 I might be wrong, but at first glance it would appear that the references used are the names of several expositions that art was showcased on? I fear that this doesn't fall under reliable sourcing as these references cannot be looked up by anyone (While being also of temporal nature). Since the article is a so-called BLP page, a Biography of a Living Person the requirement for sources is several notches higher than it would be for other article's to be accepted.

 What you are looking for are sources such as newspapers that can confirm what is written in the article itself. There might also be coverage in other literature such as magazines that can qualify as reliable.  (Contact me,Contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello Mr.feedhigh 
there are few things i want to make you clear
1)
why I wrote descended from """"old royal families in Nepal"""" not just Mallas is because i have some tangible evidence for this """" I myself is a newar and I think you know for a fact that most newars has an old god or a place dedicated to worship the old gods called """" Kul devta / kul devta mandir"""". Our temple is located in Balkumari hill (near Balkumari mandir in Patan) according to the """"purohit """" of the temple who also happens to be our """"purohit"""" (Sorry I can't find a good translation for this word """"purohit"""" in english) has a recorded document (I can provide the document if you like to examine it, also give you the contact address of the purohit himself, whos living near Mangal Bazzar even today) states that the """"kul devta"""" temple was erected at the time of Bhaskar verma by his second son Diwakar verma as a tribute to the god called """"Bhairav"""" and thats how were descended and still worship the same place and temple even till this day. Also according to the same purohit we adopted """"Shrestha"""" (changed from Verma) in the time of jayasthitti Malla (the reasons purohit told my there was a lot of instability in Patan and family feuds happening , but am not sure the exact reasons. If you want details, like I said I can give you the contact of  the """"purohit"""" who gave me this information you can also go to him to examine the document. Hence, this is the reason I wrote descended from old royal families in Nepal.

2)
Second you removed [during shah dynasty] yes it seems ironic serving the same people who later happen took our whole race out of power but there is a lot of history here too and history has to be written as it happened . What can i say is that you have to accept defeat sometimes , but it doesn't mean we will always be defeated , or accept that defeat for all eternity ( All I want to say is .This 2006 revolt where you probably think a  lot of Newars participated is not the only revolt that Newars has supported , if you look at history from the time of Damodar Pandey to Ranas, lot of Newars has reovlted , be it from house of Tripura from bhaktapur or others that followed it , but as always these revolt has been hijacked , for the most recent I wold like to give you the name Puspe Kamal Dahal """"prachande"""" .As always there is one prachande in the story. Like I said history has to be written as it is . I personally come from a family where my forefathers served as general and strategists for Shah Dyansty , my Great grand father was the first person to open a soda factory in Nepal ( even King Mahendra was astonished that we could make soda in Nepal) he also did a lot of things but am not here to publicize my family . What I want to remind you is that not all the Shah kings were anti Newar . There were Shah kings who patronize Newar's Arts and Language too in history. and I think we have to credit them for this and not forget them.

No admissions made, nor is this anything ridiculous never mind your opinion. Like I said you just want your opinionated version everywhere, please spare at least the talk page. And if you are talking about being lame, you for yourself added a citation tag to my comment here(this is a talk page ffs), how lamer can you get?

The Girvaaurus were the first people to discover Maldives, and they sailed from the Malabar Coast which constituted erstwhile Tamilakam back in the old times. And the Maldives like many of the island territories in the Indian Ocean was under Chola rule for a brief period and hence is mentioned in one of their Chronicles. Its a pity your knowledge relevent to Maldiveds is so limited, and yet you can actively spend time in searching out an e-book and check out how many Tamil and Malayalam words exist in them. Whatever 'goodwill' and 'constructiveness' are you talking about, I cannot comprehend.

Clarifications(II)

I'am totally unable to comprehend all that you have flooded into here, but I'll try to answer them all in a brief possible manner unlike you, who only seem interested in diverting and escalating everything.

Chiefly, the content here talks of Maldives being a translation of 'Mala Dvipa' in Sanskrit and 'Mahiladiva' in Sinhala. It only says MAY HAVE DERIVED and not that it had been derived likeyour POV claims.So since I'am not convinced of this fact, nor can you convince me; why don't you simply blank the section and I might as well keep mum and go away as well. 

Mala Dvipa in Sanskrit translates into Garland of Flowers which in turn in Tamil becomes 'MalaiThivu'. So the list is not only giving a translation of plainly the term Maldives into Tamil but rather supports the claim that 'மாலைத்தீவு' which means Garland of flowers(the google translates is as not maldives;if it was only a name translation) was used to refer to the island.

I had already accepted(and told this too) that the first source bore no significance; But I never used it to clarify the content that was there, it is OBVIOUS, I'am using the third source, and you are just making it seem you were ignorant or too stupid to scroll down and verify.

 Pathetic Motorways, and the """"Walton Summit Motorway"""" 

I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a """"Wacky Website"""", but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!

UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of """"unsigned"""" motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.

The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the """"parent"""" motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.

As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short """"spur"""" motorway actually links two different motorways.

If it is part of the M65, as the """"start of restrictions"""" sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state """"M61 (M65)"""", meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  

A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the """"start of restrictions"""" sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states """"A57(M)"""", but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the """"Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995"""" that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).

The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a """"C"""", """"D"""" or """"U"""" classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

John Lear:
On March 21, 1989 Bob asked me if I wanted to watch a saucer test flown and I said sure, when?. He said they are going to test fly tomorrow night just at sunset. He and I, Gene Huff and Bobs wife drove in my motorhome up to the back road into Groom Lake and parked just outside the restricted area. Just after sunset the saucer came up from behind the mountains and did some gravity jumps. I got a good look at it with my 8 inch Celestron after it had finished performing and was gently and slowly descending. It 
looked like a flying saucer oriented about 30 to 40 degrees with resepct to the horizon and was 'glowing' yellow or gold color, actually 'radiating' the color. I watched it for about 15 seconds before it settled back down behind the mountains. The was March 22, 1989. George Knapp went with Bob the following Wednesday and filmed it. The following Wednesday after that, April 6, 1989 was when we all got got.

26676,46ac13b15fe463bb,"Scarab bug tracking software 

Yesterday I was reading through Comparison of issue tracking systems and followed the link Scarab.

This lead to a disambiguation page. The page listed:
An open source bugtracker software

This text and the links contained are extremely confusing. The disambiguation template clearly states that if an internal link (such as the one from the comparison) leads to this disambiguation page, you should change that incoming link it to point to the appropriate article. Since the article did not exist and since the item in the list for the application was confusing, I decided to create a Scarab Bug Tracking page.

To make things as seamless as possible, I quickly copied the text from the old item into the new article, intending to improve the article as soon as it was created. Before I could make my modifications, you changed the content to link back to the list or something similarly stupid. (I would go back and read exactly what you changed it to, but you deleted the page, so I can’t check the history)

After I reverted your changes and then made some minor changes to the content, I put the page up for move proposal to Scarab (software) to be more consistent with pages that are from disambiguation pages.

This morning I came back to the page to check if it had moved, but it was gone! I assumed that maybe it was just moved and that the old page no longer existed. I poked around the Move proposal list, and the disambiguation page that I had originally edited (Still in that state) and could no longer find the page.

As a person unfamiliar with all Wikipedia bullshit politics and confusing processes, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened to the page I had created less than 24 hours ago. Finally I found it, the person who originally ruined my short article after less than ONE MINUTE of my edit, - you -, deleted it!

In your comments, you did not explain the reason for deletion, you only sited “A3”. To anyone but a Wikipedia user extremely familiar with deletion, this would be meaningless. An “article too short” would have been much better. After digging around a lot, I found that it was a reference to the third reason an _A_rticle could be deleted. Hence, the A3. You should AT LEAST link to that so people that aren’t familiar with Wikipedia jargon can figure out what that means without searching through piles and piles of horribly disorganized Wikipedia-politics-ridden pages.

Considering that the content I posted stated that it was a stub, the time it takes to delete an article, and the relative ‘freshness’ of the page, it makes you look like a deleting troll. If you thought that the page was clearly grounds for deletion, you should have put that inside the article or something and let it stand for a good 48 hours before finalizing the deletion.

I agree that Wikipedia should not be laden with content-free articles, but having cyclic links from the disambiguation page, to the bug tracking software page, and back is worse. If there is no article to link to, there should be no link.

The only things that you achieved by deleting the page is: made yourself stand out as a stereotypical Wikipedia troll/nazi/zealot, put off a Wikipedia contributor from continuing to improve the quality of Wikipedia, wasted a lot of my time to investigate what the hell happened to the page I created, and broke at least two internal links.

You violated the spirit of Wikipedia and smashed what little hope I still had for the Wikipedia community. Congratulations, asshole.

128342,ae609006f911fe6f,""":::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are """"official"""" are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.

Second point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier. 
Im going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging, (Talk)

Text moved from article

 has been making extensive changes to the article.  Some of them changed clear and precise to less clear and precise language (such as """"implies that"""" to """"leads to the view that""""), some changed one stylistic approach to another, and some turned U.K. in to U.S. English, but the main section is this:

""""The second horn of the dilemma (known as divine command theory) runs into five main problems. First, it implies that the moral status of things is wildly contingent—if he had wanted to, God could have made rape, murder, and torture morally right. Secondly, it threatens the  normative force of the claim that God is good—it turns into the mere claim that God is consistent, or that God approves of himself. Thirdly, it commits the naturalistic fallacy; to analyze evaluative claims (e.g., that murder is wrong) in terms of what God has or hasn't said is to reduce evaluative claims to mere descriptions of God's activity. Fourthly, it seems to make morality subjective, with moral truths determined by the mere attitudes of an individual. Fifthly, it threatens the conception of God as a  rational being. For, supposing God had a reason for forbidding rape, this reason should also be the reason that rape is wrong. Otherwise, God's decision would have been based on the wrong reason. But if the reason rape is wrong is that God has forbidden it, then it can't be God's reason for forbidding it, on pains of circularity. So God's moral decisions were based either on the wrong reason, or on no reason at all.""""

Some of this can usefully added, but some isn't really acceptable: """"is wildly contingent"""" is not only unencyclopædic style, but is less clear than """"is arbitrary, based merely upon god's whim"""".  It also introduces technical terms where they're not needed (as does """"normative force"""" which, in addition, surely misses the target; it's not the normativity of """"god is good"""" that's at issue, but its status as a meaningful evaluation).  His or her fourth point isn't very commonly raised, and is surely implicit in the other points.  The final point contains material that could be made use of, but is in fact a discussion of the article's first point.   (Μελ Ετητης) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem with the whole """"505%"""" thing is that 5x the insolation at the top of the atmosphere does not necessarily equate to 5x the insolation at the surface.  The effect the atmosphere has as far as where that energy ends up  scattered back into space, absorbed and reradiated in the upper atmosphere, trapped near the surface via a runaway greenhouse effect, etc.  is huuuuuuuge.  We don't know anything about the atmosphere, so it's not really as cut and dried as you might initially think.  I agree with you that some of the media coverage has been a bit more cheerleader-ish than is warranted, and don't particularly want to see that stuff in the article either.  What would be useful to incorporate is a presentation of the literature's discussion of what would be required for Gl 581 c to actually be habitable.  The Selsis paper has a pretty nice treatment, although it's a bit scattered here and there  still worth a pretty close look if you get a chance.

So we have one JP source using the Israeli name and one JP source using the standardized arabic name: Jerusalem Post: Shattered Heights that other source """"The Soils of Israel by Arieh Singer"""" specifically calls the mountain """"in northern Israel"""", that shows not by whom it is written by that its non-neutral and unreliable but the fact that he calls a mountain internationally recognized as part of Syria as """"in Israel"""" that makes it unreliable in setting its name.

I'll see what I can do once I get back from holiday next week. Would you possibly be able to check the article once I write it and advise me on any revisions or structural changes that ought to be made? I'm afraid I am somewhat a beginner on Wikipedia and haven't tried an article effectively from scratch before, so any assistance would be much appreciated.

I shall also include as much as possible about his childhood and subsequent accession to the throne.

I can't believe that someone would insult me on a personal level just because they assume I have done something;  I am deeply hurt that you would call me homophobic- my college education is in defending people from discrimination, why on earth would i discriminate against anyone?  I would also never think of vandalizing the site, i didn't even know i could delete or rewrite things on here!  In using this website i understand that it is public opinion and not fact, and why would i have the right to change or vandalize anyone elses opinions and/or beliefs?

Compatibility
Paul Thurott has written an article about compatibility issues with the Beta, which makes me doubt the final release's compatibility.  

Removed Features
 
 
 _/|\_I don't know why the Removed Features section claims that the classic start menu and taskbar will be
 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely   

 Beta Release 

The date of the release of the Beta should be January 7 (Release on MSDN to TechBeta and TechNet customers) or January 9 (Release to public) ?? -  Excuse my English (talk me) 06:04, """,0,0,0,0,0,0
